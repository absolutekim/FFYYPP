Escher (1898-1972) are always on display at Escher in The Palace. You can enjoy his early Italian landscapes, his distinctive tessellations, his impossible buildings and his world-famous metamorphoses. Escher’s development as an artist is a key focus in the museum. His early work consists of early woodcuts of people and unrivalled depictions of nature and landscapes, in which he explores his talent. In his later work he develops his revolutionary tessellations, metamorphoses and optical illusions. Eternity and infinity are ever-present in his artworks, with his many tessellations providing ample evidence of this. The two themes crop up in many forms in The Palace. On the second floor you can immerse yourself in an interactive world that will teach you to see like Escher. Here you will puzzle with your eyes and play with your hands!","info@escherinhetpaleis.nl","538013","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/16/54/a7/escher-in-het-paleis.jpg","Netherlands",,"52.083473",,"nl","Escher in The Palace","The Hague, South Holland Province","4.314305","Escher in The Palace","Kon.

The superb collection of Empire furniture, clocks and chandeliers date from that period. The collection of Empire furniture is one of the best preserved and most complete collections in the world.

All phases of the history of our struggle against water are still visible here. The unique collection of 19 mills in an authentic Dutch landscape is a true eye catcher. With your ticket you'll have access to all visiting locations and tour boats for four hours. The Nederwaard Museum Mill shows how families lived and worked in our mills around 1900. At the Blokweer Museum Mill, you’ll experience what life was like in the fifties of last century. In the Overwaard Museum Mill and the adjacent education barn everything revolves around technology. Watch our multi-screen film in Secondary pumping station 'De Fabriek' and visit the historic Wisboom pumping station from 1868. Get on board of our tour boats and enjoy Kinderdijk from the water. Feel the wind, smell the water and listen to the sound of the windmills. The Kinderdijk World Heritage site is open almost the entire year!",,"321125","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0b/30/e2/91/moulin-kinderdijk.jpg","Netherlands",,"51.883896",,"nl","Werelderfgoed Kinderdijk","Kinderdijk, South Holland

The building was opened on October 1, 2014, by Queen Máxima of the Netherlands. Besides the large market hall, the complex houses 228 apartments, 4600 m2 retail space, 1600 m2 horeca and an underground 4-storey parking garage with a capacity of 1200+ cars. The Markthal was designed by architectural firm MVRDV. The grey nature stone building has an archwise structure like a horseshoe. The building has a glass facade on both sides, these are made up of smaller glass windows. The smaller windows are mostly squared and around 1485 millimeters wide. All of these are hung around a structure of steel cables, 34 metres high and 42 metres wide, which makes it the largest glass-window cable structure in Europe. Each facade has 26 vertical and 22 horizontal cables. The inside of the building is an 11.000 m2 artwork by Arno & Iris Coenen, named Hoorn des Overvloeds (Horn of Plenty).","info@markthal.nl","7129022","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1d/ab/8e/8a/markthal-rotterdam.jpg","Netherlands",,"51.920174",,"nl","Markthal Rotterdam","Rotterdam, South

Take a stroll to soak up the rousing yet beautiful lights, or visit the Red Lights Secrets Museum to learn more about Amsterdam’s sex work profession. The district is also known for its trendy coffee shops, bars, and clubs. The best time to see the district is in the early evening or at night, when the lights begin to illuminate the narrow streets. The area is safe, but it can get very busy, and taking photos or videos of workers is illegal. –

The Mill is situated in the outskirts of Amsterdam not far from Schiphol Airport. It controls the water level in the western part of Amsterdam. This area is situated more than 2 meters below sea level. The Sloten Windmill is a rebuilt mill, dating from 1847. The whole year long the Mill can be visited daily (except Jan. 1st, April 27th and December 25 and 26). The windmill is a non-profit organisation, run by volunteers. Knowledgeable guides will gladly explain the working of the mill during a guided tour. And if possible the miller will demonstrate how the top of the mill is turned, or how to stop the mill.","info@molenvansloten.nl","3704720","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/ba/b5/c4/de-molen-van-sloten.jpg","Netherlands",,"52.34153",,"nl","Molen Van Sloten","Amsterdam, North Holland Province","4.792232","Molen Van Sloten",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"15620122","Sloten En Riekerpolder","15620191","Dorp Sloten","15620064","Amsterdam New West",,,"538",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+31 20 669 0412","670","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ba/b5/c4/de-molen-van-sloten.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/cd/db/2a/molen-van-sloten.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ba/b5/c2/de-rondleider-verteld.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ba/b5/85/rembrandt-schildert-saskia.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ba/b5/6c/de-molen-van-sloten.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ba/b5/64/de-maan-boven-de-molen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ba/b5/5e/de-molen-van-sloten.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ba/b2/74/de-molen-van-sloten.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/c2/2d/eb/the-miller-operates-the.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/c2/2d/e9/the-capstan-wheel-to.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/c2/2d/e6/the-sails-of-the-windmill.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/c2/2d/e4/the-wallower-and-the.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/c2/2c/12/sloten-windmill-amsterdam.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/b7/19/1f/de-enige-keer-dat-de.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/b7/18/97/in-september-2021-bestaat.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/cf/90/43/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/cf/90/42/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/cf/90/41/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/cf/90/40/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/82/2f/56/the-sloten-windmill-and.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/9c/4b/0a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/9c/4b/09/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/9c/4b/08/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/9c/4b/07/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/64/e6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/64/d1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8e/ed/1e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8e/ed/1d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7e/fa/3c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7e/fa/3b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/73/8c/f3/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/73/8c/f2/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/73/8c/f1/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1187","8","#8 of 1,187 things to do in Amsterdam","5","2","0","13","72","451","4.436651706695557","45","working windmill","26","guided tour","8","inner workings","7","windmill tour","4","water pumping","3","volunteer staff","3","wind mills","8","tram stop","7","personal tour","6","fantastic tour","5","central amsterdam","3","well worth the visit","28","netherlands","8","sails","22","rembrandt","7","engineering","62","history","3","polders","5","role","3","mechanic","4","importance","4","technology","8","video","3","structure","10","dutch","12","canal","3","depth","3","attic","3","facts",,,"Museums",,,,"Specialty Museums","History Museums",,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d3704720-Reviews-Molen_Van_Sloten-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html","https://molenvansloten.nl/"

Since its foundation by Johan Burgers, the first owner and the one who named the animal park in Arnhem, the park has always remained a real family business. Already from its inception the zoo caused a sensation due to its daring new organisation, which naturally is in the way the animals' accommodations are shaped as well as in the way the experiences for the visitors are created. Burgers' Zoo has a rich history, which has shaped the zoo into the way it is today, and as you can still find it now in the wooded area just north of

The museum breathes the atmosphere of the 18th and 19th centuries - the Age of the Enlightenment - when people were busily gathering knowledge about the world. Teylers Museum, museum of wonder, is a world in itself, one that you will never forget. Teylers Museum is the best-preserved 18th-century public knowledge institution for the arts and sciences in the world. It has been open to the public since 1784, welcoming all those who are eager to look at paintings and drawings by the Old Masters, magnificent minerals, ingenious scientific instruments, precious books, and centuries-old fossils. The museum's interior alone, with the monumental Oval Room, is a truly remarkable attraction. It is the only authentic 18th-century museum interior in the world. Recently the historical house of founding father Pieter Teyler was added to the museum.","info@teylersmuseum.nl","319192","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/b5/05/9f/teylers-museum.jpg","Netherlands","false","52.380352",,"nl","Teylers Museum","Haarlem, North Holland Province","4.640345","Teylers Museum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"20484359","Centrum",,,,,,,"1126",,"$3.28",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/09/e5/81/44.jpg",,"Viator","$240.45","Cultural Tours","222043P2","$241","Haarlem Walking Tour.

Right here, the tank battle of Overloon unfolded in the autumn of 1944. The village of Overloon was totally devestated back then. In order to remember the casualties and victims of that episode the museum was founded in 1946, even before the village was rebuilt. Nowadays over 100,000 people visit the museum every year. The first exhibition is about the occupation of The Netherlands from 1940 till 1945. The second large exhibition, displayed on 10.000 m2, contains over 150 military vehicles and artillery, both from allied forces and German. In addition to these two main exhibitions there are several smaller presentations, of which the Battle at Overloon presentation is definitely worth a visit. A museum restaurant and a shop completes this museum, which can be found in the so called Liberty Park in Overloon.","info@oorlogsmuseum.nl","319463","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/36/b1/d8/nederland-in-de-tweede.jpg","Netherlands","false","51.570114",,"nl","Oorlogsmuseum","Overloon, North Brabant Province","5.95822","Overloon War Museum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"675",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+31 478 641 250","905","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/4f/cb/fa/a-knocked-out-sherman.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/36/b1/c5/een-moderne-tentoonstelling.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/9d/f1/04/barc-4x4-with-wheels.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/9d/f0/f1/jagdpanzer-hetzer.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/9d/f0/df/spitfire.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/9d/f0/d2/8-8-cm-flak-18-battle.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/36/b1/f7/koningen-wilhelmina-zat.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/36/b1/f2/in-vijf-dagen-was-de.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/36/b1/e6/van-bezetting-tot-bevrijding.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/36/b1/d2/interactieve-vraagstelling.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/e4/a6/a1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/90/46/56/eingangsbereich-ausstellungsha.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/00/17/a7/d6/war-museum-oorlogsmuseum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/a2/9f/6d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/a2/9f/6a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/95/65/45/a-day-at-the-meseum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/37/f4/54/20181101-141125-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/a0/cb/68/20180709-134915-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/d6/ee/b7/oorlogsmuseum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/11/fa/58/photo1jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/92/ca/79/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/92/ca/78/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/92/ca/77/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/92/ca/76/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/92/ca/75/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/92/ca/74/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/92/ca/73/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/6c/89/e0/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/6c/89/df/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/53/69/7e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/53/69/7d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/53/69/7c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/d1/ca/63/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/d1/ca/62/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/d1/ca/61/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/d1/ca/60/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6","1","#1 of 6 things to do in Overloon","4.5","5","7","36","184","443","4.086777210235596","31","military vehicles","27","war museum","10","impressive collection","3","no idea","3","personal stories","3","english translation","2","canadian army","2","horsa glider","38","exhibits","25","equipment","26","tank","26","german","31","netherlands","14","guns","9","shells","8","stuff","8","artillery","8","enthusiasts","5","teenagers","5","text","4","region","4","period","4","connection","4","phone","2","replica","2","title","2","utility","3","aspects",,,,,"Museums",,,,"Military Museums",,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188585-d319463-Reviews-Overloon_War_Museum-Overloon_North_Brabant_Province.html","http://www.oorlogsmuseum.nl/"

On an interesting tour under the proverbial smoke of Tilburg, you will learn all about this – by the producer’s own modest account – “valued atmosphere enhancer”. Introduced during Carnival in 1973, Schrobbeler has always maintained a strong link with this fun annual festival. Learn all there is to know about Schrobbeler – with the exception of the family secret of course – on one of the fun guided tours. Smile, warmth and friendship Tickets for one of the open tours at 1.30pm on Saturday or Sunday can be booked at schrobbeler.nl. Groups of fifteen people or more can also book on other days and times. And it’ll be well worth it, as confirmed by one guest: “We had a very enjoyable but also successful afternoon. The staff are friendly and were keen to tell us about the history of Schrobbeler.

Civilians also play an important role. Come and see our collection of authentic weaponry, documents, footage and photographs. The new multilingual audio tour provides 50 exhibits with personal background stories. Historian and bestseller author Antony Beevor voiced the English audio tour.

The Park is famous for its rare animal and plant species. There are excellent possibilities for wildlife observation in the Park. With over 40 kilometers of paved cycle paths, free to use White Bicycles and a lot of different walking routes, the Park offers something for everyone. The Kröller-Müller Museum - located in the center of the Park - shows works of great masters like Van Gogh, Picasso and Mondriaan. The visitor will also come across a number of monuments by famous architects Berlage and Van de Velde in the Park. The famous country residence/museum Jachthuis Sint Hubertus is perhaps the most impressive example. The special combination of nature and art guarantees a Park with a high recreational and educational value. Due to the high natural value, the area is also assessed by researchers as very valuable.","reserveringen@hogeveluwe.nl","195073","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/13/13/b6/32/vlakbij-kroller-moller.jpg","Netherlands","false","52.078438",,"nl","De Hoge Veluwe

Shortly after the disaster, the council commissioned the reconstruction of the most startling church of Holland. With 123 meters it is also the longest church in The Netherlands THE 72 STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS ARE WORLD-FAMOUS Entering the Church of St. John, one falls silent at the sight of the majestic space with the 72 world-famous stained-glass windows. That first experience will only get stronger when you see the marvellous light by the 'Dutch Masters' invading the Church. The rich history of Holland can be read in the large windows. It is a beginning of an impressive discovery along biblical and historical scenes of human emotions.

Great service, warm atmosphere, superb beers and delicious food.” That was the response from an American visitor to this specialist beer experience at Cafe 100 Watt (Eindhoven City Brewery). Its artisan kitchen means you can combine wonderful home-brewed beers – with names inspired by local landmarks such as Witte Dame and Heeren van Eynthoven – with a slow cooked Picanha or Brewers Ribs, for instance. Or simply come along and enjoy the large pavement cafe of the Proeflokaal 100 Watt (Tasting Room 100 Watt) by the Dommel, in the middle of the city

But the only place to find high-quality reproductions of all of his works is the Jheronimus Bosch Art Center in the city where the late-Mediaeval painter lived and worked his whole life. Come and admire the impressive exhibition set in a magnificent church building and you'll understand one visitor's summary of the experience: ""I’ve learned a lot of Jerome Bosch. He is a great, and the most creative painter ever in history. This is a museum must see."" Barely a quarter of an hour's walk from the station and just five minutes from St. John's Cathedral, this original and refreshing museum is home to all of Bosch's works and more. The reproductions can be found on the ground floor, while the other floors house collections of contemporary art, all inspired by Bosch himself. You can also take the lift to the very top floor of the tower for a fantastic view over the city.","info@jheronimusbosch-artcenter.nl","3728046","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/cf/fd/57/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","Netherlands","false","51.688103",,"nl","Jheronimus Bosch Art Center","Den Bosch, North Brabant Province","5.312103","Jheronimus Bosch Art Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"450",,"$0.30",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/13/2c/8c/39.jpg",,"Viator","$27.32","Cultural Tours","303448P13","$28","Discover the best spots in Den Bosch with Outside Escape","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FEindhoven%2FSelf-guided-Outside-Escape-Walking-Tour-in-Den-Bosch%2Fd24978-303448P13%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=db781ab7491eef335&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=3728046&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+31 73 612 6890","342","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/cf/fd/57/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/cf/fd/e8/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/cf/fd/d1/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/cf/fd/bd/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/cf/fd/a4/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/cf/fd/89/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/cf/fd/75/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/cf/fd/35/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/cf/fd/14/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/bc/39/f9/the-front-of-the-jbac.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/47/0e/ac/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/8d/ec/58/replica-de-tuin-der-lusten.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/a1/28/56/de-karavaan-in-de-woestijn.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/60/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/5f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/5e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/5d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/5c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/5a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/59/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/58/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/57/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/56/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/55/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/54/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7f/92/53/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d2/c8/f7/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d2/c8/f6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/4a/b1/fb/jheronimus-bosch-art.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/82/bd/ae/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/82/bd/ad/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","1","#1 of 3 Concerts & Shows in Den Bosch","4.5","4","12","32","156","246","3.9454634189605713","34","tower","66","bosch","16","church","7","elevator","2","exposition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shopping","Sights & Landmarks","Museums","Concerts & Shows","Art Galleries","Concerts","Churches & Cathedrals","Historic Sites","Art Museums",,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188581-d3728046-Reviews-Jheronimus_Bosch_Art_Center-Den_Bosch_North_Brabant_Province.html","http://www.jheronimusbosch-artcenter.nl/"

Cuypers and built in the period from 1895 to 1930. The Cathedral Basilica is based on the classic form of a three-aisled basilica with chapels along the aisles and chapels along the choir. Because construction took a lot of time and a period of lack of funds in the diocese building temporarily brought, Cuypers was given the opportunity to present his designs several adjustments during construction and perform. The building therefore has an eclectic style, mainly neo-Romanesque and neo-Gothic elements alongside Moorish and Assyrian ornament shapes and influences of Art Nouveau and the architect H. P. Berlage. Recently artworks of Jan Dibbets, Gijs Frieling and Marc Mulders were added to the interior. Without doubt a very special building. Activities at this monument: KathedraalMuseum, Willibrord Organ plus periodically vault tours and climbing the towers.","info@bavo.nl","3702490","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2e/d3/47/7f/caption.jpg","Netherlands","false","52.376534",,"nl","The Grote or St. Bavo Church","Haarlem, North Holland Province","4.622128","The Grote or St. Bavo Church",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"367",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+31 23 553 2040","393","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/e5/3c/23/st-bavo-kathedrale-kirche.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/d3/46/f0/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/e2/5a/b1/cathedral-of-sint-bavo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/13/39/1e/kathedraal.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/13/39/14/kathedraal.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/13/39/0c/kathedraal.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/09/5d/dc/cathedral-of-saint-bavo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/4a/f6/68/cathedral-of-saint-bavo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/fe/c9/7a/very-rare-and-well-preserved.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/c6/2b/ca/cathedral-of-saint-bavo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/c6/2b/b8/cathedral-of-saint-bavo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/e9/e9/02/binnen-in-nieuwe-st-bavo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/78/bf/02/cathedral-of-sint-bavo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/5f/5a/09/cathedral-of-sint-bavo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/5f/59/e1/cathedral-of-sint-bavo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7a/b4/45/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7a/b4/44/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7a/b4/43/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7a/b4/42/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/75/6a/63/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/d3/47/7f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/75/6a/64/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/75/6a/62/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/75/6a/60/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/75/6a/5f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/75/6a/5e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/75/6a/5b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/75/6a/5a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/63/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/62/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/61/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/60/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/5f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/5c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/5a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/59/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/58/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/57/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/56/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/55/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/54/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/9b/fd/53/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"134","4","#4 of 134 things to do in Haarlem","4.5","3","4","25","129","206","3.9903786182403564","4","amazing building","2","beautiful stained glass windows","2","self guided tour","7","grote markt","23","organ","10","mozart","2","flagstone","3","recital","9","amsterdam","3","beauty","3","square",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sights & Landmarks",,,,"Churches & Cathedrals",,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188593-d3702490-Reviews-The_Grote_or_St_Bavo_Church-Haarlem_North_Holland_Province.html","https://www.bavo.nl/"

The watchtowers, which were built a hundred meters apart, have been reconstructed. The barrack, rebuilt at half the original size, shows how the prisoners lived. The Children’s Memorial lists the names and ages of the 1,269 Jewish children who were deported in June 1943. There is also an authentic crematorium.

A 'wonder room' of brilliant inventors and their boundless imagination, technical ingenuity and especially infinite passion. Bizarium museum inspires and wonders with ingenious, scientific and crazy inventions.

This park is like a desert, surrounded by a small forest. There are 6 main entries, and at each entry there's a restaurant and lots of parkingspace available. The ""duinen"" (in English it's called dunes) is a great area to walk or cycle around (there is a special cycle path) and there are tracks for mountainbiking and horsebackriding. Children can build sandcastles or treehouses, and dogs love the area, because at certain places they can run around loose. It's sort of a beach without the sea! Also great for picknicking, sunbathing, children's parties, groupgames, etc. A real popular NP in our province!",,"3198021","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/54/cc/ca/national-park-de-loonse.jpg","Netherlands","false","51.64829",,"nl","National Park de Loonse en Drunense Duinen","Drunen, North Brabant Province","5.127532","National Park de Loonse en Drunense Duinen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"311",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"270","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/db/87/3d/20200823-183836-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/59/c4/91/de-sahara-van-brabant.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/1d/86/0e/nationaal-park-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/1d/85/ef/nationaal-park-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/1d/85/dc/nationaal-park-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/1d/86/5a/nationaal-park-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/1d/86/51/nationaal-park-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/1d/86/40/nationaal-park-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/0e/25/95/national-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/9d/e8/7e/filename-dsc01478-jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/59/af/f2/zandvlakte-in-het-park.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/7f/96/b3/nationaal-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/25/af/da/prachtig-wandelgebied.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/25/af/d5/prachtig-wandelgebied.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/25/af/d3/prachtig-wandelgebied.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/25/af/d1/prachtig-wandelgebied.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/49/20/0a/trilha-dentro-do-parque.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/15/82/79/nationaal-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/15/82/72/nationaal-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/15/82/6b/nationaal-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/c7/5f/a4/national-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/c7/5f/8c/national-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/c7/5f/8a/national-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/c7/5f/89/national-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/c7/5f/88/national-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/c7/5f/87/national-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/c7/5f/86/national-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/c7/5f/84/national-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/c7/5f/7e/national-park-de-loonse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/44/51/08/peace.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/44/51/06/unusual-park.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/44/51/03/interesting-sand-inland.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/44/50/ff/foot-prints-in-the-sand.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"9","1","#1 of 9 things to do in Drunen","4.5","0","1","8","110","192","4.113455295562744",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nature & Parks",,,,"National Parks",,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1745456-d3198021-Reviews-National_Park_de_Loonse_en_Drunense_Duinen-Drunen_North_Brabant_Province.html","http://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/natuurgebieden/nationaal-park-loonse-en-drunense-duinen"

And it's just a stone's throw from Schiphol airport. The earlier you get here, the more you see. From the Visitor Centre, walk across a gallery through the auction complex.

Here, you will learn all about prehistoric times and can walk among life-size dinosaurs and other extinct species! The remarkable fossils on display take you back ages, while the lovely Prehistory Garden (Oertijdtuin) offers ‘living fossils’ and also plenty of amazing trees and bushes. Add to this the playground and exciting Prehistoric Forest (Oertijdwoud), and this educational museum is a fantastic day out for families with children aged between 4 and 12. As one of our young explorers put it: “We’ve had another great day here, plenty to see and do!” A modern way of experiencing the past Open from 10:00 to 17:00 Tuesdays to Sundays, this museum offers several special packages for children’s parties and also lays on up-to-the-moment themed evenings. Although this is a museum all about things from a very long time ago, visitors can have a surprisingly modern experience here by turning up for a Pokémon Go evening, when they can use the DinohunterBoxtel app to hunt dinosaurs through the village of Boxtel! The museum is the pride and joy of the village and this augmented reality dinosaur hunt is the perfect way to appeal to 21st-century explorers. Something else this museum has to offer is fun scavenger hunts. Country park The museum also houses the visitor centre for Het Groene Woud (The Green Forest), which is a country park in the triangle between ’s-Hertogenbosch, Tilburg and Eindhoven. Here, you can dive into history, hop on a bike for a gorgeous ride through the landscape, enjoy the authentic local produce, strike out on a hot-air balloon adventure or stay for one or more nights locally: there is so much to see and do between these cities. Museum shop and museum café The museum shop offers all kinds of fossils, gemstones, jewellery, books and cuddly toys, but also maps of walking routes and cycle paths through Het Groene Woud country park. Treat yourself to a snack or a drink in the museum café, and if you’ve worked up a real appetite after a day on the trail of the dinosaurs or building your own wooden dinosaur, the multilingual museum staff will be glad to direct you to any of the several atmospheric cafés or pancake restaurants in the locality.","admin@oertijdmuseum.nl","8051984","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/ed/05/b1/oertijdmuseum-de-groene.jpg","Netherlands","false","51.607975",,"nl","Het Oertijdmuseum","Boxtel, North Brabant Province","5.320714","Het Oertijdmuseum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"212",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+31 411 616 861","264","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/3b/ae/bf/het-oertijdmuseum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/11/f4/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/0d/98/12/dinobos-van-het-oertijdmuseum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/39/62/6c/oertijdmuseum-de-groene.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/be/91/42/dino-buiten.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/73/5c/35/interactief-bezig-zijn.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/78/73/a6/photo0jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/ed/05/b1/oertijdmuseum-de-groene.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/39/62/48/oertijdmuseum-de-groene.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/cd/80/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/cd/7f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/cd/7e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/cd/83/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/cd/82/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/cd/7d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/cd/81/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/cd/7c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/25/43/96/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/1f/22/74/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/1f/22/73/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/1d/23/56/het-oertijdmuseum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/1d/23/0b/het-oertijdmuseum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/d3/13/9c/the-main-hall.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/d3/13/8b/t-rex-sue.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/81/2b/4d/20180907-113450-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/81/2b/4c/20180907-131837-largejpg.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"20","1","#1 of 20 things to do in Boxtel","4.5","2","2","17","77","114","4.026475429534912","3","nice place","10","dinosaurs","4","kids","3","woods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Museums",,,,"Natural History Museums","Specialty Museums",,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2450332-d8051984-Reviews-Het_Oertijdmuseum-Boxtel_North_Brabant_Province.html","http://www.oertijdmuseum.nl"

And what an experience! In one of the most beautiful buildings in De Pijp, realistic studies take you through many centuries of painting. From the Renaissance to modern times. Or for the art lover: from Jan van Eyck to Piet Mondriaan. You start with The Garden of Earthly Delights, the world-famous triptych by Hieronymus Bosch, and The Birth of Venus by Botticelli. Then you will come face to face with the Mona Lisa and, on the basis of 50 studies of the most iconic paintings, you will be transported through centuries of painting. Van Gogh, Vermeer, Degas, Renoir, Mondrian... you can admire them all lifelike in the many rooms. There is even a room dedicated to Monet, where you are part of a 360° painting of the Japanese bridge in his garden in Giverny.","info@rtxp.nl","25261894","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/28/0c/27/3a/360-0-impression-of-the.jpg","Netherlands","false","52.357483",,"nl","Rtxp Amsterdam","Amsterdam,
