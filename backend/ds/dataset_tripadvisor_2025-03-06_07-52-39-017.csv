An additional goal is the creation of the center for research and documentation of our musical tradition.","info@thirathen.com","12786114","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/8a/97/79/tampour.jpg","Greece",,"35.336872",,"el","Μουσείο Παραδοσιακών Οργάνων","Heraklion, Crete","25.130213","Museum of Musical Instruments",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"125",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+30 281 071 1196","141","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/1b/92/47/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/8a/72/c8/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/46/27/d4/building.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/46/27/b8/percussions.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/46/27/b3/indian-musical-instruments.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/46/27/a3/bagpipes.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/46/27/9f/entrance-building.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/46/27/90/building.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/46/27/89/lyras.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/46/27/7c/percussions.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/46/27/74/lyras.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3c/d7/7c/luthier.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3c/d7/75/percussions.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3c/d7/6f/musical-instruments.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3c/d7/5a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3c/d7/40/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3c/d7/2e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3c/d7/27/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3c/d7/1d/luthier.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3c/d7/0d/reception.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/45/71/d1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/45/71/d0/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/45/71/cf/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/cf/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/ce/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/cd/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/cc/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/cb/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/ca/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/c9/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/c8/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/c7/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/c6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/c5/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/c4/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/c3/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/c2/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/c1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/c0/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/bf/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/bc/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/bb/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/ba/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a4/db/b9/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,"102","1","#1 of 102 things to do in Heraklion","5","0","0","0","1","124","4.410374641418457","2","charming village","3","culture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Museums",,,,"Specialty Museums","Art Museums",,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189417-d12786114-Reviews-Museum_of_Musical_Instruments-Heraklion_Crete.html","https://www.thirathen.com/en"

You'll find quaint shops selling jewelry, clothes, ceramics, and souvenirs, plus sidewalk restaurants and family-run taverns serving authentic Greek food. Being one of the oldest neighborhoods in Athens, you’ll be able to see Roman columns, medieval churches, and ancient landmarks like the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. The area gets busy, especially during summer, so visit in the early morning or late afternoon for fewer crowds. Explore Plaka and the nearby landmarks on a guided tour of Athens—it will typically include the Acropolis, Parthenon, and other ancient temples and museums. –

The most famous temple, the Parthenon, was dedicated to the goddess Athena and is considered the peak of Greek art. You can avoid long lines by joining a walking tour of the site. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring sunscreen, as the walk up the hill can be steep and exposed to the sun. For the best experience, visit early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the heat and for fewer crowds. –

Don't be put off by the name 'museum', this is not a sterile exhibition of dusty artefacts but a carefully restored Cycladic olive mill. The attention to detail in the restoration is incredible and this alongside a video presentation and a personal talk by the owner make this a really special and informative experience. It is the best preserved animal-powered old olive mill in Andros island. The mill was restored and transformed into museum, in order to offer to every visitor, regardless of age, the option to come close to the underling culture of the valuable product and to get familiar with the old traditional techniques of olive oil production as well.
