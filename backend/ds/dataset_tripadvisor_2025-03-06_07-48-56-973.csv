Some are as old as time. Some are forever intertwined. The Confluence Historic Site & Parkland is a destination for locals to find a sense of identity and connection to the land they live on, and where tourists can learn the stories and cultures of this special place. When you visit The Confluence, you stand on the traditional territory of the Blackfoot and the people of Treaty 7, including the Siksika, the Piikani, the Kainai; the Tsuut’ina; and the Bearspaw, Chiniki and Wesley Nations of the Stoney-Nakoda. This is also homeland to the historic Northwest Métis and to the Otipemisiwak Métis Government Nose Hill Métis District 5.

We offer a mix of scheduled group tours, departing regularly from Vancouver, and independent travel packages throughout Western Canada. What does it mean to Live the Adventure? Adventure can be defined in many ways. For some, adventure can be extreme experiences like bungee jumping or whitewater rafting. For others, it can merely be heading into uncharted territories and exploring. Or it can be the wonderment of finding a new favourite destination. At Discover Canada Tours, we believe that adventure is whatever you make it be. With this in mind, we provide some of the most authentic experiences throughout Western Canada and into the Pacific Northwest. We make sure that every single tour that you take with us is an adventure and something that you’ll take home with you and never forget.","info@discovercanadatours.com","2080065","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/24/f3/61/e5/logo.jpg","Canada","false","49.284557","636 Hornby Street, V6C

Come and meet the Governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company as he strolls through his garden, barter with the company clerk, sit in a tipi and listen to the whispers of ancient legends, and touch the coarse fur of a bison hide at the oldest stone fur trading post in North America – or, if you prefer, scour the fort for clues in a family scavenger hunt. There is something here for the whole family.Living-history programs run mid-May – Labour Day, 9:00 – 5:00 daily. Daily guided tours in English and French and motorized access for mobility challenged visitors available. Regularly scheduled tours are offered in September.

Here, you can find colorful storefronts, bustling streets, and a variety of restaurants and specialty shops. Visit the quaint teahouses and intriguing herbal stores, as well as browse the clothing stores. When hungry, pop by the steaming noodle houses for some wonton soup, hunt for the famous Peking duck, or go on a dumpling crawl. At night, Chinatown lights up in bright neon red, with lanterns lining the alleys and Chinese music blaring from the karaoke bars. Combine your visit here with a trip to Little Italy and Kensington Market—both within walking distance. –

Based out of Canmore, this family operated company has been in operation since 1995, and is eager to share their love of dog mushing after spending their early years on the sprint race circuit. The fully guided tours include the option to drive your team with a guide, harness the dogs, and reward the dogs with a biscuit and water after the run. Transportation is provided from Canmore and Banff (surcharge applies). Enjoy the scenic ride through the Canadian Rockies! Two hour tours are offered from December through April, and the four hour tour runs from January through March. The dogs are Alaskan and Siberian huskies that come from a racing background. About 60% of the dogs are adopted in from other kennels, giving them a second chance at being a sled dog! The kennel follows the practices of Mush with PRIDE, an international organization promoting sled dog wellbeing.","info@howlingdogtours.com","1729066","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/68/4a/f1/teams-of-alaskan-huskies.jpg","Canada","false","51.08893","Box 8055, Canmore, Alberta, Canada, T1W 2T8","en-CA","Howling Dog Tours","Canmore, Kananaskis Country, Alberta","-115.34891","Howling Dog Tours",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"494",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+1 403-678-9588","403","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/68/4a/f1/teams-of-alaskan-huskies.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7b/92/61/friendly-guides-and-huskies.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7b/92/60/spray-lake-provincial.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/69/da/bc/quest-and-lita-leading.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/69/da/2e/sit-back-and-enjoy-the.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/69/d9/f1/tours-in-the-beautiful.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/69/d9/72/siberian-huskies-love.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/69/d9/1c/half-day-tour-on-spray.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/68/4a/f3/get-those-dog-cuddles.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/fa/e4/95/howling-dog-tours.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/fa/e4/85/howling-dog-tours.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/fa/e4/7f/howling-dog-tours.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/60/5c/32/howling-dog-tours-ltd.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/5d/5a/50/dogsledding-in-the-canadian.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/85/f6/12/cute-dog-waiting-to-run.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/4c/dd/3f/20191214-130015-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/a9/88/f8/photo2jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8a/bc/c8/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8a/bc/c7/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/63/35/31/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/41/86/01/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/29/91/dd/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/29/91/dc/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/29/91/db/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/29/91/da/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/29/91/d9/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/29/91/d8/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"72","7","#7 of 72 Outdoor Activities in Canmore","4.5","17","3","11","43","420","4.202094078063965","46","hot chocolate and cookies","37","bucket list","5","van ride","24","spray lakes","15","awesome experience","17","beautiful scenery","5","snow pants","7","amazing tour","61","harness","63","musher","65","driver","42","sleds","60","company","34","pet","25","treats","57","mountains","43","adventure","26","office","27","activity","11","teams","22","winter","14","alberta","10","canadian","12","rockies","6","kennel",,,,,,,,,,,"Tours","Outdoor Activities",,,"Nature & Wildlife Tours",,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g181727-d1729066-Reviews-Howling_Dog_Tours-Canmore_Kananaskis_Country_Alberta.html","http://www.howlingdogtours.com"

Built between 1877 and 1886 in the architectural style of the Second Empire and inspired by the expansion of the Louvre in Paris, this unique structure was recognized as a Québec national historic monument in 1985. Its architecture and rich ornamentation illustrate the words engraved above the main entrance, “Je me souviens” (I remember), which later became Québec’s motto. Many species of trees, shrubs and plants representative of the wide variety of flora native to Québec can be observed when walking around the gardens surrounding the Parliament Building.","renseignements@assnat.qc.ca","155591","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/c0/89/0d/parliament-building-hotel.jpg","Canada","false","46.80899","1045 Rue des Parlementaires,

Apart from its historical past, the Park is to Québec what Central Park and Hyde Park are to New York and London: a city park of outstanding value, the lungs of the city. The Plains of Abraham Museum is the gateway to the Park, offering exhibitions, activities, services and all information for your visit. Year-round, dive into history with an interactive exhibition on the battles of Québec and an exhibition on artefacts from the Park's archeological collection. From July to the end of October, explore the Plains of Abraham with the Escape Bag Rally or a family treasure hunt. Discover also the dark side of the Plains with fun and terrifying activities for all ages during Halloween and the Month of the Dead. In winter, enjoy cross-country skiing, snowshoeing or ice skating!

Its rich encyclopedic collection, distributed among five pavilions, includes international art, world cultures, decorative arts and design, and Quebec and Canadian art. The Museum has seen exceptional growth in recent years with the addition of two new pavilions: the Claire and Marc Bourgie Pavilion, in 2011, and the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace, in 2016. The MMFA complex includes Bourgie Hall, a 460-seat concert hall. The Museum also houses the Michel de la Chenelière International Atelier for Education and Art Therapy, the largest educational complex in a North American art museum, enabling the MMFA to offer

As the surf comes crashing in, you will find surfers from around the world carving through the peaks of the waves.

Be transported back in time as you wander down the cobblestone streets and admire the stunning architecture. Check out the Bonsecours Market for some unique shopping, stroll along St. Paul Street, and visit the Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal to admire the incredible stained glass windows. You can also head to the old port for a Ferris wheel ride, zipline, or cruise. Take a walking tour to learn more about its history or a ghost tour to explore the neighborhood after dark. Visit in the winter to see the beautiful holiday decorations. –

Between May and October, the Citadel is brought to life by two historic regiments of the British Army - the pageantry of the 78th Highlanders and the precision of the Royal Artillery thrill visitors daily with live re-enactments. The skirl of the bagpipes mixes with the crack of a rifle and the assembly of recruits for the next foot drill. There's no shortage of authentic experiences to view and participate in! Kids will love the Xplorers Program - an activity book just for them. When the sun sets, it's time to experience the other side of the Citadel - join the Halifax Citadel Ghost Tour and experience the dark and errie lore from the early 1800's. Tours start mid-July and run select Friday and Saturday nights starting at 8:30pm until the end of October. Between Nov. to April, all exhibits and rooms are closed but noon gun fires daily.","halifax@pc.gc.ca","155412","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/5f/d6/f8/photo9jpg.jpg","Canada","false","44.64749","5425 Sackville St, B3J 3Y3","en-CA","Halifax Citadel

The hiking trails around the lake offer varying levels of difficulty, but the Rockpile Trail offers some of the best views. If you want to fully immerse yourself in the area, stay at the lakeside hotel and take an early morning canoe ride. The infrastructure here is basic, but that only adds to the natural beauty. Plan your visit from mid to late June to catch the incredible reflection of the mountains in the lake. –

For thrill seekers, the park features 70 rides including 17 roller coasters and the all-new Yukon Striker, the world's fastest, tallest and longest dive roller coaster. And for families, the park includes 2 children areas with rides, games and live entertainment. In addition, cool off in Splash Works, a 20 acre water park or take in any of our world class live shows and special events. Each fall brings the return of Camp Spooky for kids and families by day, and Halloween Haunt's frightening attractions by night. And new for 2019, families can enjoy WinterFest, where the park will be magically transformed into a winter wonderland full of enchantment and holiday cheer.","guestservices@canadaswonderland.com","185018","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/90/48/be/entrance-to-canada-s.jpg","Canada","false","43.842373","L6A 1S6","en-CA","Canada's

Get up close on a boat ride (be prepared to get soaked!), enjoy amazing aerial views from the Skylon Tower or on a helicopter tour, stroll along the White Water Walk, or hit the Journey Behind the Falls attraction that offers views of the falls from below and behind. Adventure seekers can also go zip-lining, jet-boating, hiking and cycling with the falls as the backdrop. For a truly magical experience, stay after dark when the falls are illuminated. For peak water flow, visit between June and August. –

You can cross the bridge by motorized vehicle, bicycle or even on foot, as long as you have your passport—though note that there is a toll fee. There are even duty-free shops on both ends of the bridge. The crossing takes less than 30 minutes, though peak summer season can see delays of up to one to two hours.

Please note that we have three seasons throughout the year:

Low season

Opportunities to experience the Fortress of Louisbourg's quiet streets during the low season allow visitors to imagine life in the toughest of conditions almost 300 years ago. While there are no services available, a low season visit may provide the best opportunity for visitors to experience the stillness of the streets, take in the beauty of the exterior architecture of the buildings, or simply enjoy the treasures that life's quietest moments may bring. 

For a new way to experience the site in the low season, try our Explora app.  Through sound, video, photos, quizzes and text, you will hold stories about Louisbourg in your hands as you walk through both the reconstructed town and the fortress's ruins.  Explora is available to download for free at the App Store and through Google Play.

 
Shoulder season

For those seeking quiet opportunities and some on-site services, visiting during the shoulder season is recommended. Visitors have the opportunity to enjoy an inspiring setting with beautiful visuals as they stand on our history-laden grounds. Several buildings with exhibits are open for you to discover. Explore the site on your own or embark on an Explora tour of the grounds. To enhance your visit you may purchase a guided tour or participate in the Time Travel program. Accessible guided tours are available as well. We recommend reserving a place on these tours in advance.

By the end of June, the site will begin to fill with costumed interpreters as we ramp up for peak season. After Labour Day, the Fortress of Louisbourg winds down once again with costumed animators interpreting some buildings into September. No matter the season, be sure to find out from reception what activities and experiences may be on offer that day.

 
Peak Season

Peak season brings a different kind of magic on-site as costumed people add life to the streets and the homes. A foggy day cloaks the site in mystery and creates scenes and images not to be forgotten. A cold day with wind and rain may draw visitors to the warmth of a welcoming fire or to the cozy inn for a warming bowl of soup. A hot day shows the town and its various gardens at their brightest. On summer feast days colour and pageantry break the routine of daily life as the townspeople promenade in their finery. Chores are the order of the day on summer and fall mornings. With the rooster's crow comes bread from the ovens that supplies both soldiers and hungry visitors.

Louisbourg's inhabitants are happy to share their stories, and can be found working the forge, tending the gardens and running the kitchens. The beat of drums and the chime of the garrison clock order the soldiers' day. The sound of a cannon marks midday. You can even fire a cannon or musket yourself by taking part in our 'Have a Blast' or 'Have a Ball' programs. Music might be heard from a waterfront tavern. Children play games in the streets, while the sentry at the gate challenges those who wish to enter the walled town. A public punishment gathers spectators. Sheep run through the streets, called home by the stable hand. Each hour offers something unique and real.

During the peak season you can immerse yourself in an 18th century dining experience, available daily, at the Hotel de la Marine and Grandchamp House. For those who prefer a modern experience L'Epee Royale Cafe offers a cozy stop for hot and cold beverages and a variety of pastries. Groups can pre-arrange a dining experience by calling 902-733-3552. The daily fare varies with the season. Please check in advance for menu options and our ability to accommodate any special dietary requirements.

Once the tallest structure on Earth for over 30 years, the CN Tower attracts travelers to its two observation decks—one of which features a glass floor. If you’re looking for an extra thrill, try Edgewalk, where you can walk hands-free on a ledge surrounding the top floors. The tower is also home to the award-winning 360 Restaurant, which completes a rotation around the structure every 72 minutes, giving you an ever-changing view of the city while you dine. –

As Canada’s contribution to aviation expanded to include aerospace technology, the Museum’s collection and mandate grew to include space flight. The Collection itself consists of more than 130 aircraft and artifacts (propellers, engines) from both civil and military service. It gives particular, but not exclusive, reference to Canadian achievements. The most extensive aviation collection in Canada, it is also considered one of the finest aviation museums in the world. Museum Highlights: Largest surviving piece of the famous Avro Arrow (its nose section); the original Canadarm used on the Endeavour space shuttle; Lancaster WWII bomber; Life in Orbit: The International Space Station
