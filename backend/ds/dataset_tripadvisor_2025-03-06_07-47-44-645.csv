My visitors come from all around the English speaking world (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, UK). In general they come to Sedan,(France) specifically for my tour as part of their ‘European tour’. The tours last a complete day and are usually based on the German attack at Sedan in May 1940 and the French Maginot Line defences in the area. The tour includes a private underground visit of a Maginot Line ouvrage( Fort). We visit the battlefield that is the area around Sedan, in the conflicts of 1640 (leading to Sedan being annexed by France), the 1870 Franco-Prussian War (the battle of Sedan was militarily the defining battle in the Franco-Prussian War), WWI (the German attack through Sedan in 1914 and in 1918 the furthest point of advance reached by the US Army), and of course the 1940 Blitzkrieg attack at Sedan through the Ardennes, and the French Maginot Line defenses in the area). We see and visit sites of Historical (military) and Heritage interest. From the medieval castle at Sedan, the old town of Sedan, fortified churches, the Maginot Line and the beautiful Ardennes countryside. All of this in the area where these battles took place. Usually the tour is based on the events in 1940, however we take in elements from the previous battles (1870 and WWI) because it is all in the same area, and the preceding battles help explain in part what happened here in 1940. Occasionally I do day tours based only on the 1870 Franco-Prussian battle at Sedan. My visitors are usually interested in military history, quite frequently they are very knowledgeable on such matters. Occasionally I have groups of serving military in larger groups coming to see the area as part of their military training. Consequently I am amending the Trip Advisor categories for my listing to be as follows: Sightseeing Tours: Evidently this is the general description of what I do. Historical and Heritage Tours: The tours are based on the historical (military) events that took place here. Private Tours: The tours are by prior arrangement and are private. Battlefields: The tours take place over the area around Sedan that was a battlefield in 1870, WWI and WWII.","tuckermaths@hotmail.com","3307325","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/04/00/de/maginot-line-tours-tucker.jpg","France","false","49.70492",,"fr","Maginot Line Tours - Tucker Tours","Sedan, Ardennes, Grand Est","4.95919","Maginot Line Tours - Tucker Tours",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"307",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+33 6 59 70 15 51","891","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/04/00/de/maginot-line-tours-tucker.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/24/4a/18/spanish-visitors-in-form.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/d4/b3/f4/british-visitors-at-the.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/d4/97/c2/bridge-over-the-meuse.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/d5/1e/6b/maginot-line-tours-tucker.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/d5/1e/11/maginot-line-tours-tucker.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/bb/af/c3/american-and-french-visitors.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/aa/05/88/this-is-the-long-bridge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/78/d6/d1/40-chaumont-sedan-france.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/0d/ee/93/finally-the-mairie-removes.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/08/75/36/dutch-visitors-at-the.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/de/c0/de/maginot-line-ouvrage.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/de/be/92/maginot-line-ouvrage.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/de/bd/b9/maginot-line-ouvrage.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/c9/59/ba/british-visitors-by-maginot.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/c9/4f/ce/indian-visitors-in-front.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/c9/4a/60/american-visitors-by.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/ae/a1/49/american-visitors-in.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/9c/d0/4f/montfaucon-d-argonne.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/26/78/1b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/bb/f7/93/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/21/53/89/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/21/53/78/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/21/52/f7/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/21/52/cc/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/21/52/ad/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/cc/d6/82/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/c2/11/da/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/c2/11/d9/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/c2/11/d8/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/c2/11/d7/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/70/ea/db/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/70/ea/da/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/70/ea/d6/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","1","#1 of 3 Tours in Sedan","5","0","0","0","12","295","4.390592575073242","169","maginot line","26","his knowledge","28","day tour","23","military history","19","the franco prussian war","13","world war","12","great tour","10","his passion","11","two days","8","german invasion","10","my son","5","would highly recommend this tour","6","informative tour","5","memorable experience","9","de la","4","an excellent guide","4","sense of humour","3","you will not be disappointed","3","underground tour","3","subject matter","3","driving around","3","numerous sites","3","fortified churches","3","met richard","3","gun turrets","4","come alive","6","meuse argonne","3","better understanding","4","first class","3","fascinating insight","Tours",,,"Private Tours","Historical & Heritage Tours",,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635787-d3307325-Reviews-Maginot_Line_Tours_Tucker_Tours-Sedan_Ardennes_Grand_Est.html","http://maginotlinetours.co.uk"

The city is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The museum, inaugurated in 1963, consists of a 17th century villa which was revamped and extented with a new wing by the architect Jean-François Bodin between 1987 and 1993. It sits in the middle of a public garden and stands in harmony with the surrounding area, offering the public a simple and engaging introduction to Henri Matisse’s work. The collection which comprises works donated to the city by the artist and his heirs is displayed in a 1200 square meters exhibition space. Its presentation helps the public to experience Matisse’s art more fully and measure the importance of one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.","musee.matisse@ville-nice.fr","191328","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/e7/0b/fb/un-musee-inscrit-dans.jpg","France","false","43.719658",,"fr","Musée Matisse Nice","Nice, French Riviera -

The medieval fortress dominates the village with its austere facade. But don't be daunted: the open drawbridge is an invitation to enter into the refined lodgings of a great lord. It is the most fully furnished castle of the Loire Valley. The hushed ambiance of the rooms and the splendor of the great reception halls will plunge you into the daily life of a 15th century prince. You will relive the event that distinguished the history of the locale: the wedding of Charles VIII and Anne of Brittany, recreated with strikingly realistic wax figures.In the park, you will discover the recreated construction site of France's oldest keep. The promenade, punctuated with playgrounds and the tree house, can be followed through cedars and sequoias to the gazebo overlooking the

My deep passion for my own region and my never-ending enthusiasm combine to insure that you will see and taste the best Provence has to offer with an emphasis on Cultural Tourism, Entertainment, & Gastronomy. 10 years of combined experience in the guest service and hospitality industries helped me understand the importance of a service that is dedicated to creating a reliable, personal, and positive travel experience. With a comfortable air-conditioned van, I can tour up to 6 passengers in my own vehicle, and up to 8 in a rental one. Along with my personal language skills and my natural curiosity and enjoyment of diverse cultures and people, you can be assured of a journey you will want to share and perhaps repeat.Representing the

The market is on every sunday from around 8 am, there is a general markey selling local produce and many other things to tempt you.

From the origins of the Second World War to the end of the Cold War, museographical displays tell this terrible side of 20th century history. Indeed, Caen, bombarded during the summer of 1944, a liberated yet martyred city, deserved a tribute well worthy of the suffering it endured. This is precisely the purpose of the Mémorial de Caen, but via a continuing perspective and action aimed at reconciliation.","contact@memorial-caen.fr","196246","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/64/e4/aa/le-memorial-de-caen.jpg","France","false","49.19737",,"fr","Mémorial de Caen","Caen,

Around the courtyard, dominated by the monumental François I staircase, an anthology of four styles of French architecture unfolds: the Gothic style with the Salle des Etats Généraux, the beginnings of Italian influence with the Louis XII wing, Renaissance in the François I wing and finally classical with the wing built by Mansart for the Duke of Orléans. Residence of seven kings and ten queens of France, the royal château is the evocative place of power and daily life at court during the Renaissance, as evidenced by the royal apartments, furnished and decorated with magnificent polychrome decorations.","contact@chateaudeblois.fr","247336","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/e1/fd/8a/ezy-watermark-13-02-2020.jpg","France","false","47.585922",,"fr","Chateau Royal de

The Court, a large number of men and women of letters and European artists, stayed here on invitation from the sovereigns, one example being Leonardo da Vinci who lies here in peace in the Château’s Chapel.This place of high renown in the History of France boasts an exceptional collection of Gothic and Renaissance furniture illustrating the artistic finery of the first French Renaissance.

In the 11th century after the Conquest of England by Duke William of Normandy in 1066, ties with England were strong. You'll see a reference to the turbulent past above the south transept portal where sculpted scenes show the life of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was assassinated in Canterbury Cathedral on the orders of King Henry II of England. The Bayeux Tapestry was kept here from the 11th to the 18th centuries, probably displayed for the first time on the day the cathedral was consecrated in 1077 in the presence of William the Conqueror.","paroisse.ndbessin@orange.fr","296212","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/6b/e9/c8/the-cathedral-is-a-major.jpg","France","false","49.27563",,"fr","Cathédrale

With its 67,000 inhabitants, it retains a 'country town' atmosphere which contributes so much to its charm. The city offers visitors a fascinating insight into 1,000 years of European history through its exceptional heritage. Wonderfully preserved from the ravages of time, its homogenous historical centre is classed as a 'protected area' and has benefited from careful restoration and ongoing improvements for more than 25 years. Colmar is really a condensed version of the Alsace region. Walking in its streets is like visiting à huge movie set with hundreds of century-old half-timbered houses, lovely canals and flourished pedestrian town center. The city has an impressive selection of quality restaurants and shops selling high-quality local products... Not to miss: the romantic and world famous district of 'the Little Venice'. Colmar is also the capital of Alsace wines and is nestled at the foot of the vineyard next to many idyllic villages. The city hosts the annual Wine Fair of Alsace in august, that has gone through six decades. This event gathers approximately 300 000 people during 15 days of music, party and wine tasting. The city with multicolored houses is also the birthplace of sculptor Bartholdi, father of the famous Statue of Liberty in New York and of Hansi, the well known illustrator of Alsace. The culture vultures will complete their visit by one of its 5 museums. We especially suggest to visit the Unterlinden Museum to discover and admire its wonderful Issenheim Altarpiece or the Toy Museum, if you're looking for something to do with your kids.","info@tourisme-colmar.com","4708416","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/25/a5/4e/vieille-ville-de-colmar.jpg","France","false","48.075832",,"fr","Vieille ville","Colmar,

Our tours are in English and last for around 3 hours. They include some walking and standing, but also feature a seated tasting with wine pairings. Our tours are designed for adults. We’re unable to host children under ten years of age. Our price of 125€ per person is a little higher than the competition because we spend more than anyone else on premium tastings and to pay the most experienced and knowledgable guides in Paris. You’re also paying for the tiny group size. You can visit our website to see our calendar of availability, and we hope to welcome you soon!","parisbymouthtours@gmail.com","2613395","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/78/d1/7d/the-before-shot-at-our.jpg","France","false","48.85627",,"fr","Paris by Mouth","Paris, Ile-de-France","2.35661","Paris by Mouth","14 Quai de l'Hotel de ville, 75004 Paris, France","0.1846848799972852","48.85363006591797","paris-paris-metro-7","7","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Métro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"14 Quai de l'Hôtel de ville, 75004","Pont Marie","2.3572189807891846","Pont Marie","8 Rue de Rivoli, 75004 Paris, France","0.20155044251468524","48.85520935058594","paris-paris-metro-1","1","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Métro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"8 Rue de Rivoli, 75004","Saint-Paul","2.3607349395751953","Saint-Paul","68 Rue de Rivoli, 75004 Paris, France","0.23514778170515493","48.85749435424805","paris-paris-metro-1","1","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Métro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Rapid Transit","paris-paris-metro-9","9","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Métro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Rapid Transit","paris-paris-metro-11","11","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Métro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Rapid Transit","68 Rue de Rivoli, 75004","Hôtel de Ville","2.351789951324463","Hotel de Ville","Prepa Architekton, 75004 Paris, France","0.3923019794917038","48.85171890258789","paris-paris-metro-7","7","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Métro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Prépa Architektôn, 75004","Sully – Morland","2.3617539405822754","Sully – Morland","35 Rue Beaubourg, 75003 Paris, France","0.4106426263546683","48.8619270324707","paris-paris-metro-11","11","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Métro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_paris.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"35 Rue Beaubourg, 75003","Rambuteau","2.3538739681243896","Rambuteau","15621598","Saint-Gervais","7236763","Le Marais","15621629","4th Arr. -

We stock a huge range of wines and beers at UK duty-free prices. Not having to pay UK duty means we can pass on savings of up to 60% on UK retail prices - on average, this means you save £4 a bottle on UK supermarket prices - often the savings are even more. We aim to have everyday low prices but whenever we can, we'll give you even better deals and special offers. We offer free crossings on both the Ferry and on Euro Tunnel.

The edifice was deconsecrated during the Revolution in 1791 and renamed the Pantheon. During the turbulent years of the 19th century, as regimes changed, it alternated in its role as a religious and patriotic monument. Since 1885, the year of Victor Hugo’s death and burial in the Pantheon, it has been the last resting place for the great writers, scientists, generals, churchmen and politicians who have made the history of France. The crypt houses the tombs of more than 70 illustrious figures including Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Emile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Pierre and Marie Curie etc.Open:> 1st April to 30th September: from 10 a.m. to 6.30 p.m.> 1st October to 31st March: from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Last admission 45 minutes before closing time.

Firstly, your local Parisian guide will take you to a patisserie to enjoy some traditional French delicacies, followed by a visit to a cheese shop to try some of Nico's favorite 'fromages'. Your personal guide will then lead your party to a classic chocolaterie where you'll have the chance to eat mouthwatering chocolates. Your tour will include a stop at a boulangerie where you can sample and learn about classic French breads and baguettes (and why you should never eat a baguette the wrong way around)! You'll also drop into a creperie for the delicious flavor sensation of eating a crepe or galette, washed down with a refreshing glass of local cider. The tour even includes a visit to a butcher shop, while there, you can taste succulent French hams and the finest cured sausages. Finally, our guide will pick out the perfect wine chosen to match your food and taste and designed to enhance the whole experience.","paris@essor.co.uk","6825442","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/0e/cc/89/ad/macarons.jpg","France","false","48.88175",,"fr","Secret Food Tours Paris","Paris,

The Domain of Chambord is made up of the château, a village, farms and a wooded area. The domain of Chambord is completely enclosed within a wall, all 5,440 hectares of it. That’s the equivalent of the city of Paris! It is the largest enclosed forest in Europe. The entire site has been the property of the state since 1930; when the public estate was created, article 230 of the law dated 23 February 2005 stated that the possessions making up the domain were given over to it without restriction or exceptions.","info@chambord.org","247337","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/16/6f/3d/d4/vista-laterale-pomeriggio.jpg","France","false","47.61581",,"fr","Château de

This name probably came from the original line of the houses on both sides of the river, which serves the southeast of the city. This district starts behind the Koïfhus, goes through the fishmonger's district and to the bridges Turenne and Saint-Pierre. It is therefore at the beginning of the Krutenau, whose etymology refers to places of market gardening on the outskirts of the towns. Originally inhabited by a rural community of wine-producers, market gardeners and boatmen, the Krutenau stretches out around the Turenne Street that the marshal took in 1674 for his triumphant entry in the city. Boat rides are possible there.","info@tourisme-colmar.com","523501","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/13/28/d9/little-venice.jpg","France","false","48.07399",,"fr","Petite

The museum traces the evolution of the Jewish world via its artistic and cultural heritage, focussing on the history of the Jews in France since the Middle Ages and evoking the communities of Europe and North Africa. Its collection, one of the finest in the world, comprises religious objects, manuscripts, textiles and unique archive documents concerning the Dreyfus Affair. Special importance is given to the Jewish presence in the arts, featuring the painters of the School of Paris (Chagall, Kikoïne, Soutine...) and contemporary artists such Christian Boltanski and Sophie Calle. The museum runs programmes of workshops for children, families and adults, guided tours, lectures, live performances and films throughout the year.","info@mahj.org","318592","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/2b/42/86/musee-d-art-et-d-histoire.jpg","France","false","48.861153","71 Rue du Temple, 75003","fr","Musée d'Art et

Heading out from Spain, cross the border to Ax-les-Thermes in France. Try traditional French cheeses and soak your feet in the warm waters of natural hot springs. Then, to the tiny principality of Andorra, where you can shop until you drop—prices are usually lower here than in the rest of Europe. There's also plenty of time to explore and see local landmarks like Casa de la Vall, the former headquarters of the General Council of Andorra.
