Start with a fantastic cable car ride, catching a brilliant sunset if you arrive here late afternoon. Once you’ve made your ascent, cross the Golden Bridge, held aloft by a giant pair of hands. There are many other attractions here—don’t miss the Linh Ung Pagoda and the giant Buddha statue. Check the weather forecast before booking your tickets, as even if conditions are relatively mild in Da Nang, it can be wet, windy, and foggy at the top in the colder months. –
