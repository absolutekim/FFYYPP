With its well-balanced selection of artefacts and exceptionally fine collections, the museum is one of the few in the world to give visitors a summary in reasonable time of the Mediterranean countries' rich and exciting history, from the earliest traces of humans in Mesopotamia and Egypt to the early Christian and Islamic cultures. The museum is in central Stockholm, in a former bank built in 1905 with a neo-classical interior unique in Scandinavian architectural history and therefore well worth seeing itself. The museum's Oriental café gives visitors a magnificent view of the Royal palace and

Only 16 of Sweden's 71 original church towns are remaining today, but the majority of these have been reduced to a remnant. The church town presumably arose from a combination of several factors: the long distances, merchants' needs for storage and accommodation at the marketplace, the church stables and last but not least the population's duty to attend church regularly. Gammelstad Church Town was put on the UNESCO World Heritage List on 7 December, 1996. Visit Gammelstad Visitor Center for more information, or to book a guided tour.

FÖRTROLLAD VARDAG - ELSA BESKOW 1 dec - 9 mars 2025 Zornmuseet i Mora hör till Sveriges mest omtyckta konstmuseer. Museet är tillägnat Anders Zorn (1860-1920) och kan stoltsera med världens största samling verk av konstnären. Ett urval av Zorns akvareller, oljemålningar, skulpturer och etsningar finns alltid utställda, ofta tillsammans med konst och konsthantverk ur konstnärens egna samlingar. Ett par gånger om året arrangeras temporära utställningar på ett av museets två våningsplan. Redan hos Zorn fanns tanken på ett museum där hans samlingar av konst och konsthantverk kunde visas tillsammans med egna verk. Planerna förverkligades efter hans död av Emma Zorn, som till sin hjälp hade en ung konsthistoriker, Gerda Boëthius. Zornmuseet i Mora stod klart 1939 efter ritningar av Ragnar Östberg, mest känd som arkitekten bakom Stockholms stadshus. Zornmuseet blev Östbergs sista verk.","info@zorn.se","196806","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/51/f3/48/zornmuseet-i-vinterskrud.jpg","Sweden","false","61.00704",,"sv","Zornmuseet","Mora, Dalarna County","14.538256","Zornmuseet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"206",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+46 250 59 23 10","132","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/51/f3/48/zornmuseet-i-vinterskrud.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/81/f4/62/sommarutstallning-2019.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/8e/d8/6b/zornmuseet.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/81/f6/cc/sjalvportratt-i-rott.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/f0/18/63/zorn-museum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/58/6b/59/the-zorn-museum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/12/ce/e4/photo3jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/57/da/03/where-zorn-lived.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/57/d9/f8/etching.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/29/00/c3/dalahast-2.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/f4/81/fd/zorn-museum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/8d/e3/69/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/8d/e3/68/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/8d/e3/65/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/8d/e3/63/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/8d/e3/61/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/63/7e/3f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/63/7e/3e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/63/7e/3d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/a8/09/99/img-20200730-143838-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/a8/09/98/img-20200730-152841-largejpg.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"16","2","#2 of 16 things to do in Mora","4.5","1","1","16","84","104","3.753626823425293","4","guided tour","2","american presidents","15","art","4","portraits","10","home","15","house","2","wealth","2","explanation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Museums",,,,"Art Museums","Specialty Museums",,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g230092-d196806-Reviews-Zornmuseet-Mora_Dalarna_County.html","http://www.zorn.se"

The city street runs through the middle of Wadköping, with buildings on each side. On one side you can see low, red houses. They are from the 17th, 18th and early 19th century. On the other side you can see what Örebro looked like after the city fire of 1854. The name “Wadköping” comes from the fictional name of the author Hjalmar Bergman’s hometown. The name can be found in the novel “Markurells i Wadköping” (“The Markurells in Wadköping”). Today there are museums, exhibitions, cafés, shops, craftspeople and a restaurant here. Wadköping is open all year and offers activities for the whole family!","wadkoping@orebro.se","4582227","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/28/60/17/b1/marknad-i-wadkoping.jpg","Sweden","false","59.272617",,"sv","Wadköping Friluftsmuseum","Orebro, Orebro County","15.232751","Wadkoping Open Air Museum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"336",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+46 19 21 62 20","333","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/60/17/b1/marknad-i-wadkoping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b2/a3/96/wadkoping-sett-fran-stora.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b2/a3/95/hostbild-av-skomakaregarden.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/bb/a9/paskmarknad.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/bb/9c/har-ar-vi-som-jobbar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/bb/97/julmarknad.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/44/52/i-skolmuseet-kan-du-se.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/44/43/i-lekladan-kan-barnen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/44/3f/teaterforestallning-pa.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/44/3d/wadkoping-ligger-precis.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/44/39/luciafirande-i-wadkoping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/44/38/skomakaregarden.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/44/35/handskmakaregarden.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/44/20/huvudgatan-i-wadkoping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/44/1a/prova-pa-gammaldags-lekar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d3/44/12/utomhusscenen-spelgarden.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/60/71/42/paskliljorna-blommar.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/60/70/6c/skymning-i-wadkoping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/60/6f/f7/julmarknad-i-wadkoping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/60/6f/45/linberedning-i-wadkoping.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/53/79/49/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/53/79/48/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/53/79/47/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/53/79/46/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/53/79/45/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/79/ee/5f/old-house-in-wadkoping.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"35","1","#1 of 35 things to do in Orebro","4.5","1","5","25","156","149","3.8713512420654297","31","shops","18","park","5","wood","4","collection","2","period","2","stream",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sights & Landmarks",,,,"Points of Interest & Landmarks","Historic Walking Areas",,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189861-d4582227-Reviews-Wadkoping_Open_Air_Museum-Orebro_Orebro_County.html","http://extra.orebro.se/wadkoping.4.6dd1f9011538e4a54e2145.html"

You also may try our Wilderness spa; wood heated sauna and hot tub in combination with a swim in the Lake. This is a typical swedish activity most appreciated during the cold season when we cut a hole in the ice on the lake.

Our Small Cafe Mangelboden offers home made cookies and several versions of coffee. You may find overnight possibilities in one of our small cottages holding 4 beds in two bedrooms. The cottages are equipped with a kitchen for your convenience, but can also be booked as B&B. For a more adventurous stay we recommend a night or two in our giant Tipi, where up to 16 persons can sleep in ready made beds.","info@ramoa.se","5112507","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/94/b1/f9/the-romantic-island.jpg","Sweden","false","57.20267",,"sv","Ramoa Adventure Village","Ramkvilla,

Here you will discover stimulating milieux and enjoy being part of history. 
 
The museum has permanent exhibitions about the region's past alongside temporary exhibitions of arts and handicrafts. Some exhibitions take up current matters of public interest and explore them from an historical perspective.
 
Every summer, the open air museum turns into Jamtli Historieland (living history theme park). The historical buildings come alive with history and role plays, where visitors are drawn into eventful and playful stories from 1785 until 1975. Jamtli Historieland enables you, as a visitor, to associate with the actors who bring to life and portray people from the past.
 
Jamtli gives access to our regional heritage and provides a place where we can discuss our values and life-styles, then and now. Jamtli gives you the opportunity to make the most of your visit. Perhaps you would like to bring your own picnic basket and spend your time relaxing in the stunning parks. Or you might want to meet the actors, such as Astrid and Sture who farm the Per Albin-torpet (The Smallholding) from 1942? Or you may be fascinated by the 1,000-year-old tapestries, ""The Overhogdal Tapestries"". You choose, so bring  your whole family, your friends, your company employees or just come on your own to an enjoyable, entertaining and magical museum where you can see, touch and act!","info@jamtli.com","285863","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/2b/66/1c/jamtli.jpg","Sweden","false","63.18702",,"sv","Jamtli","Ostersund, Jamtland County, Jamtland and Harjedalen","14.63664","Jamtli",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"284",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+46 63 15 01 00","180","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/44/a2/e8/entren.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/2b/66/1e/logo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/44/ab/a3/flygbild.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/44/a2/c3/nationalmuseum-jamtli.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/57/e8/dd/ostersund-sweden-and.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/77/af/ef/jamtli-offers-an-exciting.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/06/ee/42/jamtli.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/9d/ec/65/photo0jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/91/cf/4d/jamtli.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/91/ce/ed/jamtli.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/91/ce/0c/jamtli.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/37/59/56/photo2jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ea/98/16/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ea/97/cb/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ea/97/8b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ea/97/59/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ea/97/46/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ea/97/38/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ea/96/d1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ea/96/bc/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ea/96/13/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ea/95/fe/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/ea/95/8f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/fe/35/37/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/fe/35/36/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/fe/35/35/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/fe/35/34/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/fe/35/33/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/fe/35/32/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/fe/35/31/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/46/04/af/sami-artifacts.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/46/04/44/some-swedish-impressionism.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"16","1","#1 of 16 things to do in Ostersund","4.5","6","7","21","71","179","3.702747344970703","4","all ages","3","audio guide","2","city centre","2","art galleries","15","actors","23","history","30","museum","6","viking","6","tapestry","6","visitors","10","sweden","5","sami","3","farm","3","activities","2","region","2","season",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Museums",,,,"Art Museums","History Museums",,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189810-d285863-Reviews-Jamtli-Ostersund_Jamtland_County_Jamtland_and_Harjedalen.html","http://jamtli.com"

This is Skåne in miniature, with 360,000 square metres of unique settings, buildings and gardens. Here, the history and diversity of the countryside are caringly kept alive. With its museums and gardens, Fredriksdal offers interesting activities for all ages, all year round. Take an explanatory walk, watch the animals grazing or join the manor maids for an interesting tour. Buy a bag of old fashioned sweets in the old town quarter, or your favourite rose in the flower shop. Find answers to your questions on nature or folklore, or just lie back and relax in a hammock. With its historical parks and gardens, houses and farms, animals, meadows, woods and pastures, all situated around an eighteenth century manor house, a visit to Fredriksdal is like making a journey back into the past.","fredriksdal@helsingborg.se","319185","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/72/2e/40/den-botaniska-tradgarden.jpg","Sweden","false","56.057446",,"sv","Fredriksdal Open-Air Museum and Botanical Garden","Helsingborg, Skane County","12.710795","Fredriksdal Open-Air Museum and Botanical Garden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"212",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+46 42 10 45 00","205","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/f8/f8/f8/fredriksdal-open-air.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/f8/f9/16/fredriksdal-open-air.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/f8/f9/13/fredriksdal-open-air.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/f8/f9/08/fredriksdal-open-air.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/f8/f8/fe/fredriksdal-open-air.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/f8/f8/ee/fredriksdal-open-air.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/58/a6/af/freilichtmuseum-helsingborg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/16/e2/6a/photo7jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/c9/96/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/fd/a5/5a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/fd/a5/59/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/fd/a5/58/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/fd/a5/57/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/fd/a5/56/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/fd/a5/55/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/fd/a5/54/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/fd/a5/53/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/fd/a5/52/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/c3/54/7b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/c3/54/7a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/c3/54/79/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/c3/54/78/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/8a/05/e5/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/8a/05/e4/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/8a/05/e3/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/8a/05/e2/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/4b/20/ea/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/a1/c3/46/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/a1/c3/45/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/a1/c3/44/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/a1/c3/43/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/a1/c3/42/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/a1/c3/41/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/a1/c3/40/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/af/e4/fe/img-20190621-150904-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/af/e4/fd/img-20190621-144523-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/af/e4/fc/img-20190621-144351-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/af/e4/fb/img-20190621-144201-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/af/e4/fa/img-20190621-144056-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/af/e4/f9/img-20190621-143833-largejpg.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"92","4","#4 of 92 things to do in Helsingborg","4.5","2","4","19","72","115","3.5776312351226807","8","town","15","animals","7","summer","3","breed","2","windmill","4","plants",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nature & Parks",,,,"Gardens",,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189836-d319185-Reviews-Fredriksdal_Open_Air_Museum_and_Botanical_Garden-Helsingborg_Skane_County.html","http://www.fredriksdal.se"

The cemetery never closes, so you can easily acces the World Heritage when you prefer, throughout the year. More than 2,000 funeral ceremonies take place at the Skogskyrkogården each year. This means that the five chapels are in frequent use and therefore closed to the public. If you are interested in the chapels and their interiors, come along for a public guided tour or book a private tour.

Kalmar Castle is considerd one of Scandinavia's most well-preserved Renaisance castles, and was considerd one of the worlds's most beautiful castles by CNN in 2019. Kalmar Castle is full of contrasts. It has a history of both elegant banquets and cruel wars. There is gold leaf on the ceiling and cannonballs in the walls. The castle has golden halls, deep dungeons, secret doors and stairs built from tombstones. Today, Kalmar Castle is uninhabited – but full of people. Visitors, guides, researchers, and organisers make the castle a living attraction every day. During the summer, Kalmar Castle is for the children to rule. The Children’s Castle Event is filled with activities for children of all ages. During winter one of Sweden's largest and most evocative Christmas fairs is held every year. Kalmar Castle also offers a restaurant and café and a gift shop.","kalmarslott@kalmar.com","319158","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/13/86/e8/kalmar-castle-photo-adam.jpg","Sweden","false","56.658096",,"sv","Kalmar Slott","Kalmar,

Our concept is famous for driving long distances if necessary! Wherever we go during the tour, we will tell you many stories about the northern lights and Vikings.  After finding clear sky, we’ll admire the northern lights and we will take pictures which we’ll send to you within 3 days after the tour. If you bring your own camera, we will help you set it up to get the best shots.  As the northern lights dance in the sky we will serve hot drinks and make a camp fire for you to keep warm.

It offers a unique collection of aircrafts, many of which can only be seen at the Swedish Air Force Museum. Perhaps the most spectacular object in the collection is the Swedish DC-3, an aircraft that was a shot down by a Soviet fighter aircraft in 1952. More than fifty years later the DC-3 was found, salvaged and put to its final resting place here at the museum. Flygvapenmuseum is a place where knowledge and play come together in a natural way. The museum's science centre, the Flight Lab, features flight simulators and experimental stations on the theme of flying. Become a pilot for a day and sit behind the controls of the flight simulator - like flying for real!","info@flygvapenmuseum.nu","813516","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/88/f7/12/flygvapenmuseum.jpg","Sweden","false","58.410248",,"sv","Flygvapenmuseum","Linkoping, Ostergotland County","15.524131","Flygvapenmuseum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"849",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+46 13 495 97 00","659","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/37/57/96/photo1jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/29/10/87/getlstd-property-photo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/88/f7/2e/hkp-1.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/88/f7/23/dc-3-an.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/88/f7/0c/jas-39-gripen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/53/75/fc/photo4jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/09/39/96/hall-1-left-hand-view.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/51/32/8f/wejscie-do-muzeum-i-jego.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/51/32/8c/przed-muzeum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/51/32/88/draken-z-otwarta-kabina.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/51/32/87/nie-tylko-samoloty.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/51/32/84/mozna-usiasc-do-kabiny.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/51/32/83/kilka-samolotow-ustawiono.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/51/32/81/ekspozycja.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/51/32/80/w-symulatorze-lotu.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/51/32/7b/draken.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/45/77/8a/uno-de-los-mejores-museos.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/45/77/52/uno-de-los-mejores-museos.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/45/77/4f/uno-de-los-mejores-museos.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/45/77/4d/uno-de-los-mejores-museos.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7d/50/d5/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/9f/be/ef/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/9f/be/ee/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/9f/be/ed/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/9f/be/ec/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/9f/be/eb/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/9f/be/ea/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/9f/be/e9/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d3/5c/8a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/33/13/d3/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/33/13/d2/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/33/13/d1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/33/13/d0/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/18/91/b9/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/18/91/b8/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/18/91/b7/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/18/91/b6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/c1/e4/b9/the-other-half-of-the.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/c1/e4/b7/the-dc-3-wreckage.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/c1/e4/b2/the-aircraft-on-the-upper.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/c1/e1/9f/the-area-in-red-is-what.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30","1","#1 of 30 things to do in Linkoping","4.5","0","0","20","208","621","4.185852527618408","27","air force","8","few hours","5","interactive activities","3","great place to visit","30","simulator","39","exhibition","6","lab",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sights & Landmarks","Museums",,,"Educational sites","Military Museums",,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189864-d813516-Reviews-Flygvapenmuseum-Linkoping_Ostergotland_County.html","http://www.flygvapenmuseum.se"

Nothing beats Amy’s wraps with organically grown vegetables and wild boar sausage, flushed down with a Färna craft beer or a wild picked berry juice.","info@wildsweden.com","3547934","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/05/23/e4/photo-jan-nordstrom.jpg","Sweden","false","59.90383",,"sv","Wild Sweden","Skinnskatteberg, Vastmanland County","15.5371","Wild Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"434",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+46 70 610 61 50","336","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/05/23/e4/photo-jan-nordstrom.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/83/5a/75/getlstd-property-photo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/f7/81/dd/wild-sweden-day-tours.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/f7/81/d8/wild-sweden-day-tours.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/f7/81/db/wild-sweden-day-tours.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/ed/b7/52/tracking-wolves-in-mud.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/ed/b7/4a/tracking-wolves-and-checking.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/ed/b7/3d/discussing-wolves-photo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/ed/b7/37/relaxing-in-the-hammock.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/ce/41/cb/our-beaver-safari-boat.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/ce/41/27/mary-guiding-a-beaver.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/ce/40/43/sunrise-in-wolf-territory.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/ce/3f/1f/marcus-relaxing-in-the.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/4d/f0/19/we-often-go-to-this-natural.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/4d/f0/18/moose-cow-and-calf-in.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/4d/f0/17/we-just-love-cooking.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/4d/f0/16/we-stand-up-for-sweden.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/4d/83/4c/hiking-in-the-forest.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/4d/83/46/beaver-watching-by-boat.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/eb/e6/d8/misty-forest.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/c5/d9/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/c5/d8/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/c5/d7/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/c5/d6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/c5/d5/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/8d/c5/d3/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/3f/8c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/3f/8b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/3f/8a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/3f/89/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/3f/88/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/3f/87/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/3f/86/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/3f/85/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/3f/84/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d6/4c/70/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d6/4c/6f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/2e/2e/f7/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/2e/2e/f6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/2e/2e/f5/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/2e/2e/f4/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","1","#1 of 3 things to do in Skinnskatteberg","5","1","1","3","29","400","4.370375633239746","36","wolf howling","5","delicious food","5","small group","3","high quality","6","an adventure","5","wild forest","6","frozen lake","5","fantastic experience","4","recommend this trip","3","big thanks","143","moose","53","nature","45","tours","82","sweden","82","wildlife","113","beaver","16","lakes","65","marcus","23","silence","8","retreat","13","sauna","12","trees","8","snow","5","hosts","4","ice","3","spirit","5","camping","4","stream","9","sightings","7","meditation","Tours","Outdoor Activities",,,"Nature & Wildlife Tours",,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2015066-d3547934-Reviews-Wild_Sweden-Skinnskatteberg_Vastmanland_County.html","http://www.wildsweden.com"

The main part of the activities is conducted at Kulturen in Lund, which is two blocks in central Lund filled with historic buildings and beautiful gardens for you to visit. Step into our houses and experience life in the city and the countryside, from the Middle Ages to the 1930s. You can also choose from among twenty exhibitions - from folk art to modern design, from medieval history to the present day, from local culture to world culture. There is always hustle and bustle at Kulturen in Lund. Here we celebrate high festivals and our own traditions such as Children's Day and Ghost Night and we offer an extensive visitor's program for all ages. When you get hungry, you can eat at the restaurant or grab a snack at our cozy cafe. Our other visitor destinations are e.g. Kulturen's Östarp, where you can experience a farm environment from the 1800s, Hökeriet, which is the oldest grocery store in Lund, The Museum of Life (Livets museum), which is about the human body functions, and the Museum of Medical History in Helsingborg, about how the perception of health and illness has changed over time. Kulturen conducts educational and scientific activities throughout the entire field of cultural history. A major part of our work consists of storage provisioning, documentation, and collection care. We also carry out assignments within archaeology and building preservation. Kulturen was founded in 1882 and has more than 3.500 members. As a member you support our work and help us to safeguard our cultural heritage for future generations.

Every year in April, the interior and design is renewed with fresh ice from Torne River and skilful ice sculptors from ICEHOTEL in Jukkasjärvi in the very north of Sweden. ICEBAR by ICEHOTEL Stockholm is open all year and has a constant temperature of -7 degrees celsius (19 degrees fahrenheit). The interior is made out of sculpted ice from the arctic Torne River, just like the glasses your drink is served out of. The bar has room for up to 60 people. The entry fee includes a cocktail and a visit lasts about 40 minutes. Children are welcome, and are served a colourful kids' drink. ICEBAR by ICEHOTEL Stockholm is centrally located on Vasaplan, next door to Stockholm Central Station and the airport shuttle train Arlanda Express. Nordic C Hotel is located in the same building as ICEBAR Stockholm. Since it opened in 2002, the ice bar has become a popular attraction in Stockholm, attracting both tourists and locals who want a slice of the arctic north in downtown Stockholm.","icebar@icebar.se","515794","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/fd/3d/84/icebar-by-icehotel-stockholm.jpg","Sweden","false","59.33167",,"sv","ICEBAR

It is a botanical garden with a strong emphasis on horticulture and the garden is divided into different sections linked by lawns with fine trees and shrubs. You will find a kitchen garden, a herb garden, perennial and annual borders, a Japanese glade, a rhododendron valley and a stunning rock garden with a waterfall. In the bulb garden you find species that are not grown anywhere else. The Greenhouses are closed and new ones will be built.
