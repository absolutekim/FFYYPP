Nestled within the compound of Rumah Terbalik is also a souvenir shop (i.e. Tamu) well stocked with handicrafts and souvenirs and the 3D Wonders Museum. Using recycled wood and materials specifically to create a more local atmosphere, Rumah Tebalik has an area of 1,500 square feet and equiped with a living room, a dining area, a equipped kitchen, veranda, two bedrooms and a toilet. This fully furnished house is constructed with a slight tilt, and with everything fitted upside down inside the house, it certainly challenges the viewers' perspective when within. The kampong house signifies our past and heritage. Upside down is another perspective of seeing something. It's meant to be a fun way of looking at ourselves and life. As it is located along the main highway leading to Mt Kinabalu, Poring Hot Spring or even Kiulu River, it can help to enhance the already existing tour packages offered by travel agencies as being a short stopover point. A visit to the upside-down house guarantees to one of your most memorable experiences and it is a must-see attraction on your Sabah itinerary.As of February 2012, Rumah Terbalik has been listed within the Malaysia Book of Records as being the first upside down house of Malaysia! The 3D Wonders Museum is where visitors can explore the uniquely themed galleries, the first of its kind in Borneo, showcasing the importance of conservation while promoting the beautiful landscapes and the myriad of local cultures present in East Malaysia. Through the use of special art techniques, two-dimensional paintings will appear to pop out of the surface and come to life, immersing you in a vivid experience like no other. Create your own wacky stories and zip-line through the entire experience as you embark on an adventure in the 3D Wonders Museum right now! This latest attraction is just beside the renowned Rumah Terbalik, Malaysia one and only Upside Down House!","elsie.trekkerslodge@gmail.com","3178527","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/76/e9/cc/rumah-terbalik.jpg","Malaysia","false","6.144392","Kampung Telibong, Batu 21, Jalan Telibong, 89250","en-MY","Rumah Terbalik","Tamparuli, Sabah","116.25422","Rumah Terbalik",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"201",,"$0.68",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/12/29/68/3d.jpg",,"Viator","$68.00","Cultural Tours","407714P2","$68","Full Day JomTour!

Tin rush in Perak began from 1848 in Taiping. Perak became the wealthiest state in Malaya. Its capital Ipoh was fondly known to many as “The City of Millionaires”. In January 1913, Malayan Tin Dredging (MTD) introduced the first dredge in Batu Gajah. Due to declined tin price, operations started to shut down and ‘floating factories’ were dismantled or sold off. Today, there is only one remaining tin dredge known as TT5. It was built in England by F.W. Payne & Sons in 1938, upgraded in 1963 and had continued its operation for 44 years until August 1982. Located about 40-minute drive from Ipoh, TT5 is now fully open for visitors to experience TT5 Guided Dredge Tour, panning and self tour inside the gallery and the magnificent view of the landscape. TT5 has been proclaimed as part of the Kinta Valley National Geopark since October 2018, hence a ‘must visit’ tin mining heritage site in Malaysia.","sales@escape.my","4546769","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1b/b2/fe/76/the-last-tin-dredge-in.jpg","Malaysia","false","4.45631","Km 9, Jalan Tanjung, 31000","en-MY","Tanjung Tualang Tin Dredge No. 5","Batu Gajah, Kinta District, Perak","101.04011","Tanjung Tualang Tin Dredge No. 5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"186",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"303","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/d0/tanjung-tualang-tin-dredge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/64/dd/tanjung-tualang-tin-dredge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/64/df/tanjung-tualang-tin-dredge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/64/db/tanjung-tualang-tin-dredge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/64/d7/tanjung-tualang-tin-dredge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/64/d6/tanjung-tualang-tin-dredge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/64/d5/tt5-trail-run-2018.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/e8/activity-group-photo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/e4/activity-group-photo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/e2/activity-horse-riding.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/de/activity-pondok-tt5.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/db/activity-tt5-guided-dredge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/d8/activity-tt5-guided-dredge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/d7/activity-anjung-tt5.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/d6/activity-horse-riding.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/d4/tanjung-tualang-tin-dredge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/ca/tanjung-tualang-tin-dredge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/c6/tanjung-tualang-tin-dredge.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/5b/62/c2/a-picture-inside-the.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/12/86/68/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/12/86/67/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/12/86/66/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/7f/79/a6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/7f/79/a5/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/7f/79/a4/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/7f/79/a3/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/7f/79/a2/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/7f/79/a1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/8c/71/3d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/8c/71/3c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/8c/71/3b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/8c/71/3a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/89/d3/7a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/87/d3/f4/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/87/d3/f3/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/87/d3/f2/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/87/d3/f1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/87/d3/f0/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11","1","#1 of 11 things to do in Batu Gajah","4.5","7","5","12","25","137","4.016957759857178","26","tour guide","3","learning experience","2","great info","6","maze park","4","clear explanation","2","first hand","2","bahasa malaysia","2","history books","3","information given","2","amazing trip","2","state government","3","friendly guide","2","educational trip","2","mr amin","2","for sale","3","great tour","2","historical place","40","tt5","12","saravanan","8","ship","11","dredging","19","perak","16","visitors","8","korek","8","kapal","2","machinery","4","sufi","6","mining","4","restoration","3","compound","Nature & Parks",,,,"Parks",,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1450229-d4546769-Reviews-Tanjung_Tualang_Tin_Dredge_No_5-Batu_Gajah_Kinta_District_Perak.html","http://tt5perak.com/"

Rush in when the doors open at 10am for breakfast, then head out and start your shopping adventure of clothes, shoes, bags, trinklets, toiletries, electronic toys. Everything the heart desires. Unique to Johor Bahru City Square is the Inner City, an eclectic mix of smallish fashion and accessory shops plus restaurants housed in a tight, quaint setting. Always a firm favorite of the ""NOW"" generation. After many hours of shopping, rest the feet in one of the numerous restaurants and cafes or indulge in a soothing foot massage, then go on to treat the rest of the body at a

In 2006 we ran our first public exhibition ""The Story of Ipoh: From Feet to Flight"", in cooperation with Darul Ridzuan Museum. Since then, supported by sponsorship, we have run several more exhibitions while continuing to seek further financial support for a permanent, lively and interesting heritage gallery for Ipoh, thus enhancing both education and tourism. This current project, our first permanent, museum quality exhibition is our first step to fulfilling this objective. Advance booking is recommended as space in the building is limited. You may book via our website by clicking on Exhibitions or by the QR Code on our brochure. It is quick and easy and you receive a booking confirmation by

The three zones—Lorong Melayu, Lorong Cina and Lorong India—feature stalls that highlight the three main races in Malaysia. Experience the different cultures and heritage as you browse through the shops. You can also snag unique souvenirs like Borneo pearls, Wau Bulan (a traditional Malay kite), and the quintessential Batik for keepsakes. When hungry, don’t miss trying local hawker fare like nasi kandar, goreng pisang, or ais kacang for a much-needed energy boost.

Penang being the only other exception. The daily ritual of eating communally is one of the most endearing of Malaysian experiences.
