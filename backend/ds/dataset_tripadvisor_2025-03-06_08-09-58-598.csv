We will arrange private, custom tours for your group of any size, and can focus your tour on nature-based activities, village homestays, educational themes, or volunteer opportunities. Handspan also offers you the chance to experience Vietnam in ways that ensure that your impacts on local environmental, social, and economic contexts are positive ones. Our expert knowledge about the places we visit and the local challenges they face, enables us to design and operate tours that promote a balance between the need for economic development and ecological preservation. We do this through working closely with local communities, partnerships with NGOs and development organizations, and ensuring our guides are highly trained in ecotourism principles","info@handspan.com","1988960","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/13/8b/46/f5/trekking-in-sapa.jpg","Vietnam","false","21.03465",,"vi","Handspan Travel","Hanoi","105.85344","Handspan Travel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"779",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+84 93 223 14 89","597","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/8b/46/f5/trekking-in-sapa.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/84/b7/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/d3/9a/41/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/84/c2/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/84/c1/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/84/c0/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/84/bf/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/84/bd/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/84/b5/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/84/a9/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/84/a1/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/84/9b/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/84/98/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/82/79/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/82/77/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/82/75/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/82/73/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/82/70/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/82/6b/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/8c/82/69/handspan-travel-day-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/86/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/85/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/84/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/83/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/82/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/81/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/80/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/7f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/7e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/7d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/7c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/f1/0b/7b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b9/66/f0/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b9/66/ef/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b9/66/ee/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b9/66/ed/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b9/66/ec/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b9/66/eb/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"626","85","#85 of 626 Food & Drink in Hanoi","5","9","8","17","89","656","4.284124851226807","57","one night","44","day trip","8","rice fields","10","wonderful trip","10","cooking class","151","kayaking","214","boat","66","sapa","324","guide","52","tourists","186","vietnam","60","travel","48","itinerary","11","hoa","7","indochina","11","dong","8","requests","12","ms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Food & Drink","Tours","Boat Tours & Water Sports","Outdoor Activities",,,"Boat Tours","Sightseeing Tours","Food Tours","Day Trips",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293924-d1988960-Reviews-Handspan_Travel-Hanoi.html","http://handspan.com"

Start with a fantastic cable car ride, catching a brilliant sunset if you arrive here late afternoon. Once you’ve made your ascent, cross the Golden Bridge, held aloft by a giant pair of hands. There are many other attractions here—don’t miss the Linh Ung Pagoda and the giant Buddha statue. Check the weather forecast before booking your tickets, as even if conditions are relatively mild in Da Nang, it can be wet, windy, and foggy at the top in the colder months. –

Our motorcycle and Jeep tours enable you to leave the tourist trail behind and see parts of Vietnam that few other travellers get to see. Riding a motorbike or travelling in a Jeep brings you closer to the real Vietnam. The motorbike is the number-one form of transport in Vietnam, and as you high-five local children as you ride through their villages, you'll be happy you decided not to travel by car. Stop where you want, when you want. You don't have to be a motocross champion either. Our tours can be tailored to every level of experience, from non-riders who can ride as pillion passengers to off-road riders who are looking for a real challenge. Motorcycle tours are flexible by nature - you can take one road or another, depending on what the group wants to ride. Our rides run from half a day to a week, and the possibilities are endless.","info@motorbiketours-hoian.com","1382413","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/af/b8/cb/getlstd-property-photo.jpg","Vietnam","false","15.900952",,"vi","Hoi An Motorbike Adventures","Hoi An, Quang Nam Province","108.31997","Hoi An Motorbike Adventures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1626",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+84 90 510 19 30","1218","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/af/b8/cb/getlstd-property-photo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/b9/4d/a5/getlstd-property-photo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/83/fa/2f/roads-less-travelled.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/c9/army-green-bikes-and.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/c4/off-the-beaten-track.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/bf/we-can-go-off-road-too.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/b7/your-next-social-media.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/ac/retro-bikes.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/a4/small-country-lanes.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/80/aren-t-they-cute.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/6d/that-s-a-photo-for-the.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/52/meet-the-friendly-water.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/45/that-s-the-best-way-to.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/34/can-you-see-how-much.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/28/private-or-group-tours.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2a/6c/10/so-much-fun-for-your.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/83/fa/15/get-into-the-mountains.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/83/f9/f9/visit-some-war-sights.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/83/f9/ea/drive-over-famous-hai.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/83/f9/dd/visit-some-sights-along.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/66/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/65/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/64/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/5c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/5b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/5a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/59/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/58/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/57/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/56/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/55/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/54/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/ec/53/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/21/f3/34/hoi-an-motorbike-adventures.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d9/25/7c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d9/22/5e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d9/22/5d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d9/22/5c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d9/22/5b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d9/22/5a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d9/22/59/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/be/7c/99/on-our-4-day-jeep-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/be/7c/1e/bunker-view-from-kha.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/be/7b/ec/definitely-take-a-jacket.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/39/44/7a/lady-buddha.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/39/44/71/top-of-the-mountain.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/39/44/68/rice-paddies.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"417","64","#64 of 417 Outdoor Activities in Hoi An","5","8","4","13","92","1509","4.342106342315674","38","marble mountain","237","mechanic","202","riders","643","vietnam","99","safety","109","hue","54","helmets","20","loop","58","insight",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tours","Outdoor Activities",,,,,"Adrenaline & Extreme Tours","Motorcycle Tours","Private Tours","Sightseeing Tours","Day Trips",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298082-d1382413-Reviews-Hoi_An_Motorbike_Adventures-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province.html","http://www.motorbiketours-hoian.com"

À Ố - derives from Làng Phố, which means ‘village and city’. À Ố Show tells a captivating story of the transition from the peaceful life of the countryside to the fast-paced metropolitan life of modern Southern Vietnam. The soul of village life and, in stark contrast, familiar scenes from the city, are beautifully brought to life -- with bamboo!
