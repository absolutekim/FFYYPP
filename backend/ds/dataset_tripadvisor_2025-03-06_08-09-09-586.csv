Don't be put off by the name 'museum', this is not a sterile exhibition of dusty artefacts but a carefully restored Cycladic olive mill. The attention to detail in the restoration is incredible and this alongside a video presentation and a personal talk by the owner make this a really special and informative experience. It is the best preserved animal-powered old olive mill in Andros island. The mill was restored and transformed into museum, in order to offer to every visitor, regardless of age, the option to come close to the underling culture of the valuable product and to get familiar with the old traditional techniques of olive oil production as well.

You'll find quaint shops selling jewelry, clothes, ceramics, and souvenirs, plus sidewalk restaurants and family-run taverns serving authentic Greek food. Being one of the oldest neighborhoods in Athens, you’ll be able to see Roman columns, medieval churches, and ancient landmarks like the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. The area gets busy, especially during summer, so visit in the early morning or late afternoon for fewer crowds. Explore Plaka and the nearby landmarks on a guided tour of Athens—it will typically include the Acropolis, Parthenon, and other ancient temples and museums. –

The most famous temple, the Parthenon, was dedicated to the goddess Athena and is considered the peak of Greek art. You can avoid long lines by joining a walking tour of the site. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring sunscreen, as the walk up the hill can be steep and exposed to the sun. For the best experience, visit early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the heat and for fewer crowds. –

Here you can enjoy the benefits of epsom salt inside a float pod where you can completely zone out and put the rest of the world aside for a while. Floating can help you relax and relieve stress, but also recover from fatigue or injury. Additionally, the float pod provides an ideal environment for meditation and careful examination of ideas. Floating is becoming the next century's best tool for self-discovery. In the quiet, dark environment of the pod, your brain can take a break from all the noise, allowing you to focus on what's really important in your life. After just a single 1 hour floating session, we promise that you will feel more relaxed than ever before, yet energised and mentally recharged. After every float the world feels like a better place to live in.

The new boat is not a glass bottom boat. The boat departs from Porto Roma in Vassilikos 08:30 . The tour isn't only sightseeing but also eco friendly and educational! The places we visit during the boat trip: Turtle Island, Turtle Island's caves, Keri caves, Agios Sostis fishing port. There is plenty of time for swimming/ snorkeling and turtle spotting. Nikos and I also dive and bring back on the boat various different animals for you to see. Afterwards, they are all gently put back in the water. After a day of discovery and sightseeing we will return to Porto Roma at approximately 17:00.","mar.herk@yahoo.com","2367735","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/25/85/22/f9/the-new-eleana-cruiser.jpg","Greece","false","37.719887",,"el","Εκδρομές Mario's Cave and Turtle Trips","Vasilikos, Zakynthos, Ionian Islands","20.979885","Mario's Cruises Zakynthos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1543",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+30 694 491 7108","2367","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/85/22/f9/the-new-eleana-cruiser.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/c0/35/96/there-are-two-toilets.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/79/e4/f3/the-eleana-cruiser.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/79/e4/d5/marios-and-nikos.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/a7/ca/68/the-boat-at-marathonisi.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/a7/ca/67/the-boat-at-porto-roma.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/85/0f/00/signs-of-mai-s-market.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/85/0e/f2/mai-s-market-in-vasilikos.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/6b/f4/e5/please-visit-my-website.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/11/88/ba/mario-s-cave-and-turtle.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/11/88/9c/mario-s-cave-and-turtle.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/11/88/92/mario-s-cave-and-turtle.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/b7/2b/4b/photo2jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/b7/2b/49/photo1jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/ed/bc/cc/just-arrived-at-marathonissi.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/b7/2b/48/photo0jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/b5/7c/91/turtle-island.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/35/bd/a7/mario-s-cave-and-turtle.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/68/90/c9/photo6jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/28/35/5c/img-20190906-093616-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/4a/84/a5/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/4a/84/a4/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/4a/84/a3/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/4a/84/a2/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/4a/84/a1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/4a/84/a0/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/4a/84/9f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/4a/84/9e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/47/16/37/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/47/16/36/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/47/16/35/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/47/16/34/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3d/9b/d8/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3d/9b/d7/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3d/9b/d6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3d/17/bb/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"18","1","#1 of 18 things to do in Vasilikos","5","4","2","7","49","1481","4.448208808898926","118","sea creatures","102","octopus","72","turtle spotting","72","marine life","84","day trip","37","recommend this trip","31","star fish","28","great trip","19","lunch stop","18","swim stops","40","porto roma","13","captain mario","13","hermit crabs","10","great knowledge","9","turtle season","31","next year","15","laganas bay","11","the crystal clear waters","10","visiting zakynthos","10","caretta caretta turtles","9","eggs","88","marios","122","holiday","171","island","24","urchins","41","opportunities","17","swims","35","respect","15","seal","9","starfishes","Tours","Boat Tours & Water Sports","Outdoor Activities",,,,,"Boat Tours","Nature & Wildlife Tours","Day Trips",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g776001-d2367735-Reviews-Mario_s_Cruises_Zakynthos-Vasilikos_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html","http://www.marios-cruises.com"
