Our elephant tours in Phuket aren’t just unforgettable — they’re an enlightening journey of learning, care, and adventure with our rescued elephants.","info@phuketelephantnaturereserve.com","20099608","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/81/3f/78/our-gentle-giants.jpg","Thailand",,"7.97649",,"th","Phuket Elephant Nature Reserve","Thalang District, Phuket","98.3262","Phuket Elephant Nature Reserve",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"304",,"$0.01",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/13/ad/5c/70.jpg",,"Viator","$33.54","Attraction Tickets","393669P3","$34","Phuket Elephant Nature Reserve Ethical Sanctuary ","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FPhuket%2FPhuket-Elephant-Nature-Reserve-Half-Day-Program%2Fd349-393669P3%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=0a26b1b86e7f4936a&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=20099608&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+66 95 675 3718","585","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3f/78/our-gentle-giants.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a9/34/77/elephants-love-to-play.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a9/34/53/walking-with-our-elephants.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a9/34/0f/enjoying-our-top-pond.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a9/33/e1/elephants-enjoying-our.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a9/33/c0/observing-elephants-roam.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3f/c2/bow-our-2nd-rescued-elephant.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3f/9f/bow-our-2nd-rescued-elephant.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3f/57/learn-to-make-recycled.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3f/31/learn-to-make-recycled.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3f/2f/jungle-nature-walk-with.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3f/26/beautiful-bow.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3f/06/visitors-enjoying-our.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3e/f9/visitors-enjoying-our.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3e/f6/welcome-to-the-phuket.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3e/e4/our-beautiful-rescued.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3e/d5/black-white-portrait.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3e/d4/covered-in-mud-to-keep.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3e/b2/beautiful-bow.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/81/3e/98/observing-our-gentle.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/1a/1a/82/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/1a/1a/81/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/1a/1a/80/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/04/e4/38/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/ec/cc/22/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/ec/cc/21/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/ec/cc/20/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/e5/05/78/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/e5/05/77/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/dd/3c/34/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/dd/3c/33/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/dd/3c/32/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/dd/3c/31/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/dd/2e/cb/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/dd/2e/ca/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"55","2","#2 of 55 things to do in Thalang District","5","0","0","1","4","299","4.480854034423828","8","rescued elephants","6","mud bath","5","our tour guide","2","short hike","2","bananas and sugar cane","2","intimate experience","2","elephant experience","2","half day tour","2","ethical elephant","2","cooking class","3","porsche","3","boe","2","boh","2","tum","3","bathing","2","mahout","2","sanctuaries","4","mr","4","sanctuary","2","introduction","10","phuket",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nature & Parks",,,,,"Nature & Wildlife Areas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297937-d20099608-Reviews-Phuket_Elephant_Nature_Reserve-Thalang_District_Phuket.html","http://phuketelephantnaturereserve.com/"

For 20 years, supported by generous donations and global volunteers, SDF has worked tirelessly to reduce animal suffering through CNVR (Catch; Neuter; Vaccinate; Return) programmes. For animals unable to be returned safely to the streets, SDF provides sanctuary, as well as local and international adoption services. SDF is a haven where sick and vulnerable dogs and cats receive world-class medical care, and love. SDF is working in several countries to help end the inhumane and barbaric dog meat trade. Guided tours available Monday-Friday at 10:00am and 1:30pm. Following the 40-minute tour, visitors are encouraged to socialise with our lovely cats and dogs. Impromtu tours are not available between 11:30am and 1:00pm, although between these times, visitors are invited to socialise in the cattery or spend time in the visitor centre.

The Inspiration:Spa by Burasari derives its inspiration from the rare and delicate Burasari flower that is nurtured throughout the Burasari Spa Resort. Our Spa concept is based on our firm belief that the foundation of happiness is a healthy body, mind and soul. Healthy Mind:Creating a healthy and peaceful mind for our guests starts from the interior design of the Spa. Our Spa lobby and relaxation zone is thought of as the transition zone, preparing the mind to start the relaxation process. This is achieved through open space, sound of chimes and water, soft warm fabrics and colors that decorate the entire Spa. Healthy Body: The Spa by Burasari concentrates on two aspects of improving life. The first is in the quality of our treatments. Included in each is a pre-treatment purification ritual to which we invite and encourage each guest to undertake. This allows the guests to begin relaxing and releasing toxins. With this in mind, the actual treatment begins with a person that is truly ready to experience completely the benefits of the spa treatment. Our treatments and massage techniques concentrate on drawing out the toxins from the body, detoxifying the body’s most important systems and improving blood circulation. The Spa menu is a result of a blend of Eastern and Western cultures; for those seeking life changing experiences, as in our alternative healing ritual or for those in need of deep tissue tension release as in our detoxification packages or for those in need of downtime to simply reflect and rewind.","spa@burasari.com","2667175","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/76/8d/f2/spa-by-burasari.jpg","Thailand",,"7.888122","บุราส่าหรี รีสอร์ท 18/110 ถ. ร่วมใจ, 83150","th","สปา บุราส่าหรี","Patong, Kathu, Phuket","98.292694","Spa Burasari Phuket",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1495",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+66 76 292 929","698","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/76/8d/f2/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/93/76/61/spa-burasari-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/93/75/e8/spa-burasari-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/78/d8/d7/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/fc/c7/3a/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/fc/c7/34/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/fc/c7/2d/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/f5/dd/16/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/f5/dc/f4/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/f5/dc/d9/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/dd/0a/e6/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/dd/02/dd/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/dd/02/d9/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/dd/02/d6/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/dd/02/d2/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/dc/ff/12/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/dc/ff/01/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/dc/fe/eb/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/dc/fe/e2/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/8b/d7/ca/spa-by-burasari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/2b/d5/6c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/23/bf/02/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/00/0c/4b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/00/0c/4a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/00/0c/49/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"182","1","#1 of 182 Spas & Wellness in Patong","5","6","11","21","88","1370","4.457465171813965","81","signature massage","60","body scrub","15","rain shower","49","oil massage","21","fell asleep","20","full body","17","relaxing massage","27","foot massage","21","excellent service","17","patong beach","67","jummy","198","therapist","212","treatment","42","daw","70","receptionist","62","mai","33","anny","14","detox","51","pressure","23","therapy","146","phuket","27","noi","32","session","12","pampering","30","appointment","33","ladies","14","neck","27","baht","24","thai",,,"Spas & Wellness",,,,,"Spas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297930-d2667175-Reviews-Spa_Burasari_Phuket-Patong_Kathu_Phuket.html","http://spa.burasari.com/index.htm"

If you think of an elephant living life in the forest surrounded by the sounds of nature then this is what we offer. Our tours offer Education, Interaction, and Observation. Visitors enjoy an up-close encounter with our beautiful elephants during the feeding program, then we walk with the elephants, stand back and observe as they roam, bathe, play, and socialise naturally, free from human touch. We give our elephants back their lives and their dignity, and in doing so, our guests get to learn about how incredible the largest land mammal on earth truly is. We look forward to welcoming you.

Stay tuned as we transition to our new wellness concept. ) Imagine a place where you can retreat from the demands of the day and immerse yourself in the environment, where each moment is designed to inspire your own sense of calm and balance. The sound of moving water connecting you to nature and brings outs streams of well being to your life. At Aqua, Traditional Thai rituals seek to provide a full body experience while harmonizing and aligning the energies that flow throughout the body.

I am the owner and have always been the only instructor at Thai Secret Cooking School & Organic Garden in Chiang Mai Thailand. I opened my home to host Thai cooking classes 10 years ago and have many more years of experience teaching Thai cooking to people from all walks of life. I am playfully strict when teaching my half menu and full day menu. I want my cooking classes to be fun, educational, entertaining, most importantly a positively memorable experience for everybody. If you are not already a Master Chef, you will not be a Master Chef after my class. My classes are for people to casually enjoy a day cooking with me and new friends. Thai Secret is in the San Sai district of Chiang Mai, about 20 minutes from the old city mote area. Included in the price of my class is round trip transportation from the downtown area and my school. Touring the local Thai market, my garden, your own copy of Thai Secret Cookbook. Hope to cook with you soon!
