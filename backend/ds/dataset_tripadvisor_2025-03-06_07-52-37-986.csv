The Sognefjell Road was designated Norway’s first tourist route in 1997 and has just been upgraded to a National tourist route in 2003. The Sognefjell Road has carried traffic since time immemorial. Fish and salt from the west and butter, hides, iron and tar from the east were carried by people on their shoulders or on horseback. The cairns helped travellers find the way in all kinds of weather. The Sognefjell Road gives you access to Jotunheimen National Park, with Galdhopiggen, Norway’s highest mountain, and several of the other of the highest peaks in Norway, and to Jostedalsbreen, Norway’s largest glacier. Here your can poke about on your own among soaring peaks, take a tour over glaciers and mountain tops with experienced guides, and go skiing all year round. The route between the inland valley, high mountains and fjord offers breathtaking contrasts in climate and topography and a variety of plant and animal life, from lower elevations with farms, pine forests and the conditions for human settlement to the alpine terrain approx. 1,000 metres above sea level. Up here you’ll find bare rock with clear traces of the last Ice Age, with grass, moss, lichen interspersed with juniper and willow. Here you’ll also find hardy polar plants such as arctic buttercup, with mountain birch here and there. Wild as well as tame reindeer live on Sognefjell, and down towards the valleys there are moose and deer. In the high mountains, eagles and rough-legged buzzards thrive. In eastern regions there may be bears, lynx and wolverines, though they are few and very shy.

Everything has been built around Trysilfjellet, where wide, long slopes snake down the sides of the mountain and continue below the tree line. Trysil comprises four interconnected ski areas, all with their own unique characteristics. From the black slopes in Hoegegga to the red, blue and green slopes at Skihytta, Trysil Turistsenter and Trysil Hoeyfjellssenter. Children areas on both sides of the mountain - where snowman Valle is the children's best friend - ensure a good skiing experience for the whole family. The Snow park is several times awarded as the best in Norway. It contains lines for all levels. Live the high life in one of Trysil's two fantastic resort hotels, hire a cabin in which several families can live together, or a modern holiday flat adapted for active people. Almost all accommodation in Trysil is located right on the slopes and has ski-in/ski-out facilities.","trysil@skistar.com","3479572","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/6e/4d/41/view-from-fagerasen-trysik.jpg","Norway","false","61.30669",,"no","Skistar Trysil","Trysil Municipality, Hedmark, Eastern Norway","12.242756","Skistar Trysil",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"298",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+47 62 45 00 00","156","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/f2/12/a3/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/2f/d9/1e/over-the-skies.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/5f/80/a1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/4f/ac/0c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/4f/ac/0b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/4f/ac/09/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/4f/ac/08/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/4f/ac/05/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/4f/ac/03/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/4f/ac/02/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/4f/ac/00/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/4f/ab/fc/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/4f/ab/fa/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/39/59/7d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/39/59/7c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/39/59/7b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/39/59/7a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e5/bc/4f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e5/bc/4e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/39/4d/16/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/29/26/a9/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/14/ba/af/music-festival-at-knettsetra.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/14/ba/ae/almost-at-the-top-of.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/14/ba/ad/the-first-two-days-of.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"9","2","#2 of 9 things to do in Trysil Municipality","4","18","10","24","89","157","3.295527458190918","15","ski school","3","great ski holiday","2","equipment hire","2","ski patrol","2","great location","2","booking system","24","skistar","15","lift","36","slopes","21","resort","18","snow","5","passes","7","skiers","4","hemsedal","5","accommodation","4","gear","2","pain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nature & Parks","Outdoor Activities",,,"Ski & Snowboard Areas",,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1006204-d3479572-Reviews-Skistar_Trysil-Trysil_Municipality_Hedmark_Eastern_Norway.html","http://www.skistar.com/trysil/"

On this exclusive king crab fishing excursion in Kirkenes, we will take you out on the fjord to find the great beast and you will see how we catch, prepare and cook it. Depending on the season, we'll drive either by snowmobile and sled out on the fjord ice or by RIB boat on the Varangerfjord where you can help pull up the crab pods. The journey will culminate in a warm farmhouse restaurant by the fjord where we'll serve the crab the northern Norwegian way – fresh, steamed and irresistible!

Bishop Reinald of Winchester was responsible for its construction. The church was built in Anglo-Norman style, probably by English craftsmen. The church' patron saint is St. Svithun, and it is reputed that his arm was one of the church' original relics. In 1272 the cathedral was damaged by fire, after which it received a new chancel built in the Gothic style. Stavanger Cathedral is the only Norwegian cathedral from the Middle Ages that has retained its original appearance and been in constant use. Opening hours: Mon-Sun 11am-7pm, June-Aug. Tue-Thurs and Sat 11am-4pm, Sept-May, closed Mon and Fri. High Mass every Sunday at 11am. Morning Mass in the Bishop's Chapel every Wednesday at 8am Thursdays 11.15-11.45.

Around 30,000 people make the trip up to the summit every year to enjoy the fantastic views from the top. On a clear day, you can see all the way south to the coast and east to Sweden. You can see one sixth of Norway from here. No matter what the weather is like, you can still buy a cup of coffee, waffles and food at the Tourist Association's 100-year-old stone cabin on the summit. You can pick your own stone from the piles around the summit and get it stamped to prove that you climbed the mountain. A new alpine slope down Gaustatoppen is planned, but this is no new idea. Had it not been for the Second World War, the alpine disciplines at the 1940 World Championships would have been arranged here.",,"3504730","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/01/c9/19/gaustatoppen-set-fra.jpg","Norway","false","59.854214",,"no","Gaustatoppen","Rjukan, Tinn Municipality, Telemark, Eastern Norway","8.64917","Gaustatoppen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"338",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"515","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/50/fc/c6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/64/c9/13/20190716-142847-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/3f/cb/ba/uitzicht.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/aa/74/d4/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/79/40/c2/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/3b/c8/00/photo3jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/27/35/63/received-10212656032531731.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/f2/04/7f/location-location-location.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/dc/fa/55/view.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/62/e2/9d/svett.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/c6/03/06/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/c6/03/05/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/71/dd/8b/veldig-fin-blomst-lagt.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/e2/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/dd/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/db/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/da/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/d9/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/d7/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/c2/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1e/9a/c4/58/it-comes-some-light-up.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/9e/f3/1f/photo3jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/9e/f3/1e/photo2jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/9e/f3/1d/photo1jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/9e/f3/1c/photo0jpg.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"18","2","#2 of 18 things to do in Rjukan","4.5","2","1","20","83","232","4.091109275817871",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nature & Parks",,,,"Mountains",,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g616206-d3504730-Reviews-Gaustatoppen-Rjukan_Tinn_Municipality_Telemark_Eastern_Norway.html","https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/rjukan/190608/"

Cod are particularly under threat and MUST be released, whereas some species may be kept. Fishing trips last for 3 hours. There is no open sea swell and after starting in 2007 not one person has been sick onboard. We fish using several methods: jigging, spinning, casting, trolling. We have two boats: -Matteo from 2019, 23ft long, with 200hp Mercury engine, takes 6 guests. Perfect for either a lower budget trip together with other guests, or a private trip for your group alone. -Victoria, from 2017, 30ft with 2 x 250hp Mercury engines takes up to 10 guests.
