It belongs to the São Paulo State Secretariat of Culture. It was founded in 1905 by the State Government of São Paulo and it is the oldest art museum in the city. It is installed in the old building of the Arts and Crafts College, designed in the late nineteenth century by the architect Ramos de Azevedo. In the 1990's it underwent an extensive renovation with the architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha's project. Pinacoteca hosts about thirty exhibitions and receives about 450,000 visitors yearly. The museum's main focus is to promote to general public a better experience with visual arts with its collection, building and historical relevance.","faleconosco@pinacoteca.org.br","311969","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/01/87/2f/pinacoteca-do-estado.jpg","Brazil",,"-23.534351",,"pt","Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo","Sao Paulo, State of Sao Paulo","-46.63368","Pinacoteca do Estado de Sao Paulo","Av.

In the Parque das Aves you will experience a direct contact with more than 1320 birds from about 143 different species. There are 16.5 hectares of lush Atlantic Rainforest maintained to provide the best habitat for our animals. This is a tour like no other. It is an unique and unforgettable experience in which you will find amazing birds. Enter our immersion aviaries to feel the beat of wings from vibrant macaws and look into the eyes of a toucan. There is plenty to feel and enjoy - beauty is everywhere and that is what motivates us every day to work for the preservation of our fauna and flora. We take into our care birds that are no longer in condition to continue living in nature and keep them in an environment where they can live happily. You are an essential part of this project. All you need to do to help preserve it is to enter into the experience with all your senses.","comercial@parquedasaves.com.br","737277","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/1e/d8/34/mae-e-filha-observando.jpg","Brazil",,"-25.61391",,"pt","Parque das Aves","Foz do

Mais do que um monumento, é um símbolo de fé, esperança e acolhimento, convidando milhões de visitantes todos os anos para momentos de reflexão, espiritualidade e conexão com a natureza. Erguido no topo do Morro do Corcovado a 710 metros acima do nível do mar, o Cristo Redentor é uma das Sete Maravilhas do Mundo Moderno. Inaugurado em 1931, o monumento de 38 metros de altura foi projetado pelo engenheiro Heitor da Silva Costa e esculpido por Paul Landowski, com uma visão que uniu arte e espiritualidade em perfeita harmonia com a paisagem natural. Elevado ao status de Santuário Arquidiocesano em 2006, o Cristo Redentor desempenha um papel essencial não apenas como marco religioso, mas também como promotor de ações sociais e ambientais que refletem os valores do Evangelho e os ODS da ONU.",,"554128","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/ab/a0/bd/o-santuario-cristo-redentor.jpg","Brazil",,"-22.9519","Estrada Do

Our job is to make our customers to enjoy these wonderful places and hidden for most people. Easy trails with amazing views, a stunning natural pool, remote and beautiful beaches surrounded by nature only, walks through the favelas, among other things. We work with private tours or small groups and we will drive to all attractions, picking up and leaving customers wherever they are staying. We offer tours just to the beaches, just to the mountains, only to the forest and tours that combine all these places. We believe that our tours are the best way to experience the nature that makes Rio very special and unique: beaches, mountains, forest and a giant city between all. So, if you enjoy any of these three things or all of them, we will be happy to show you some of the most beautiful places you have ever seen! Are you interested?
