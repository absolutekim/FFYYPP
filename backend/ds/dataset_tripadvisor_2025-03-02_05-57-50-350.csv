This tour allows you to understand what happened after Korean War, from 1950s to present days.   It is a DMZ tour but we don't get to go inside the DMZ, DMZ is the border and heavily minded area, we go into the military zone which is outside the DMZ and visit 3rd infiltration tunnel dug by North Korea and observatory to see and understand the DMZ and division.   By the way, this is DMZ tour not JSA, JSA is the place where the armistice was signed and where the president of the USA went to shake his hand with the Leader of North Korea in 2019, this specific tour, please look for JSA tour.   Please bring the passport since we are going into military zone   We hope to meet you all.",,"26249516","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e3/3f/1c/caption.jpg","Korea","false",,,"ko","Private DMZ tour(Tunnel / Observation) with hotel pick up","Seoul",,"Private DMZ tour(Tunnel / Observation) with hotel pick up",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"44",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"35","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/11/62/4a/b7.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/12/3b/09/4e.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/11/62/47/6b.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/11/62/47/7c.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/11/62/47/7b.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/11/62/47/7e.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/12/86/70/64.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/49/90/5c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/49/90/5b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/49/90/5a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/49/90/59/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/bf/49/27/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/bf/49/26/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/bf/49/25/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/bf/49/24/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/bf/49/23/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/a0/f4/6e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/a0/f4/6d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/a0/f4/6c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/86/d3/75/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/b9/2d/a9/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/64/d6/3e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/64/d6/3d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/64/d6/3c/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5","0","0","0","1","36",,"2","korean culture","6","juno","5","dmz","3","history",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g294197-d26249516-Private_DMZ_tour_Tunnel_Observation_with_hotel_pick_up-Seoul.html",

As the largest underground shopping mall in Asia, it has over 300 shops and restaurants spread across four floors. Catch a movie at the cinema, marvel at over 40,000 sea creatures at the aquarium, or snap a photo in front of the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves at the iconic Starfield library. Getting there is easy, as the mall is connected to two subway stations. Otherwise, you can join a guided tour of Gangnam to explore more sights including the nearby Bongeunsa Temple. – Tripadvisor",,"554303","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/d4/26/62/caption.jpg","Korea","false","37.511185","(우) 06164강남구 영동대로 513","ko","스타필드 코엑스몰","Seoul","127.06021","Starfield COEX Mall","111-8 Samseong 1(il)-dong, Seoul N/A, South Korea","0.2097984845654336","37.514217376708984","seoul-seoul-metroplitan-subway-9","9","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Seoul Metropolitan Subway","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"(우) N/A111-8 Samseong 1(il)-dong","봉은사 ","127.06027221679688","Bongeunsa","172-82 Daechi 2(i)-dong, Seoul N/A, South Korea","0.22986267875030827","37.508827209472656","seoul-seoul-metroplitan-subway-9","9","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Seoul Metropolitan Subway","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"(우) N/A172-82 Daechi 2(i)-dong","삼성동 중앙 ","127.06316375732422","Samseong Jungang","172-82 Daechi 2(i)-dong, Seoul N/A, South Korea","0.24804403748518444","37.50874328613281","seoul-seoul-metroplitan-subway-2","2","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Seoul Metropolitan Subway","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"(우) N/A172-82 Daechi 2(i)-dong","삼성","127.06352233886719","Samseong","77-76 Cheongdam-dong, Seoul N/A, South Korea","0.71512443210028","37.519100189208984","seoul-seoul-metroplitan-subway-7","7","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Seoul Metropolitan Subway","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,,,,,,,"(우) N/A77-76 Cheongdam-dong","청담 ","127.05182647705078","Cheongdam","1-236 Jamsil 7(chil)-dong, Seoul N/A, South Korea","0.737263523994134","37.51102066040039","seoul-seoul-metroplitan-subway-2","2","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Seoul Metropolitan Subway","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit","seoul-seoul-metroplitan-subway-9","9","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Seoul Metropolitan Subway","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,"(우) N/A1-236 Jamsil 7(chil)-dong","종합 운동장 ","127.07364654541016","Sports Complex","7778646","Samseongdong / COEX","15565993","Gangnam-gu","15566056","Samseong-dong",,,"878",,"$48.00",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/12/49/28/78.jpg",,"Viator","$119.06","Private Sightseeing Tours","30791P376","$120","Private Tour Guide Seoul with a Local: Kickstart your Trip, Personalized","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FSeoul%2FSeoul-Kickstart-Your-Trip%2Fd973-30791P376%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=57849e0b44d6162a8&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=554303&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/0a/99/0e/a8.jpg",,"Viator","$279.00","Cultural Tours","104358P7","$279","Essential Gangnam Tour (Incl.

Thanks to his strenuous efforts and strong will, we now have the beautiful garden that represents the quintessence of Jeju. Consisting of 7 small gardens and auxiliary facilities, this Spirited Garden provides spaces where you can find peace of mind surrounded by waterfall, ponds, stone bridges as well as trees. All the garden trees, bunjaes, and stones allows you to relieve yourself from any everyday life burden and to take a respite to enjoy the beauty of the nature. High walls built in order to protect trees from strong winds became castles and the architectures built to house exhibitions and to serve convenience purposes now represent the beauty of the nature in Jeju.

The tour itinerary and schedule is entirely focused and planned around you.   More exclusivity While group tours rely on buses filled with other travellers, private tours allow you to choose who will accompany you on your trip.  Special care and assistance Having your own personal guide and transportation provides you with that extra special care and attention. This is especially helpful if you are travelling with young children, elderly relatives, disabled travellers, those with medical conditions, special needs or mobility issues.  Your own personal tap of local knowledge Having your own personal guide means there is no competing with other travellers to get the attention of your guide or to have your questions answered. Instead, you’ll have access to a tap of local culture and knowledge.",,"19751471","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/21/e5/fc/caption.jpg","Korea","false",,,"ko","8 hours Private Tour in Seoul for the VIP","Seoul",,"8 hours Private Tour in Seoul for the VIP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"210",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"132","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/11/d8/5e/7f.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/11/d8/5e/9e.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/11/d8/5e/c3.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0f/44/aa/77.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0f/44/aa/78.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0f/44/aa/79.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0f/44/aa/81.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0f/44/aa/83.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/11/d8/5e/80.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0f/44/aa/84.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0f/44/aa/86.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0f/44/aa/88.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0f/44/aa/89.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0f/44/aa/8c.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/0f/44/5d/26.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-674x446/09/ff/d6/67.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/20/dd/2c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/c5/a3/89/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/c5/a3/88/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/9c/5e/e9/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/56/fb/ca/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/48/59/03/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5","0","0","0","6","192",,"3","full day tour","3","south korea","2","thank you so much","2","vip travel","2","amazing experience","2","nami island","2","dmz tour","12","nancy","5","information","4","english","2","journey","2","highlights","3","moon","2","itinerary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g294197-d19751471-8_hours_Private_Tour_in_Seoul_for_the_VIP-Seoul.html",

Otherwise, take the short but steep course to Uisanbong Peak. Plan your visit for autumn, where the park comes alive with stunning fall colors.

Located in one of the world’s largest shopping complexes, you can soak, scrub, and sweat it out at one of the many themed baths and spas. An electronic bracelet keeps track of food, drinks, and services purchased—your ticket is valid for a couple of hours based on how much you spend. Spaland is excellent for solo travelers, couples, and groups of friends, but children under a certain age are not permitted to enter. Visit on weekday mornings for fewer crowds and cheaper entry. –

The name Garden of Morning Calm originated from when Rabindranāth Tagore, an Indian poet, called Korea ‘the Land of Morning Calm.’ The founder and his employees have strived to embrace the natural beauty of Korea, oriental mystique, and the spirit of the Korean people in the garden. The design of the garden focused on curves, spaces and asymmetric balance, and Korea's unique beauty to express classic elegance and
