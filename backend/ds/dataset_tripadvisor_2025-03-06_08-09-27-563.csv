On this exclusive king crab fishing excursion in Kirkenes, we will take you out on the fjord to find the great beast and you will see how we catch, prepare and cook it. Depending on the season, we'll drive either by snowmobile and sled out on the fjord ice or by RIB boat on the Varangerfjord where you can help pull up the crab pods. The journey will culminate in a warm farmhouse restaurant by the fjord where we'll serve the crab the northern Norwegian way – fresh, steamed and irresistible! All our tours include warm outfits, mittens, balaklava and shoes.","info@snowhotelkirkenes.com","2553517","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/14/d9/cf/42/happy-guides-presenting.jpg","Norway","false","69.67682",,"no","Snowhotel

Bishop Reinald of Winchester was responsible for its construction. The church was built in Anglo-Norman style, probably by English craftsmen. The church' patron saint is St. Svithun, and it is reputed that his arm was one of the church' original relics. In 1272 the cathedral was damaged by fire, after which it received a new chancel built in the Gothic style. Stavanger Cathedral is the only Norwegian cathedral from the Middle Ages that has retained its original appearance and been in constant use. Opening hours: Mon-Sun 11am-7pm, June-Aug. Tue-Thurs and Sat 11am-4pm, Sept-May, closed Mon and Fri. High Mass every Sunday at 11am. Morning Mass in the Bishop's Chapel every Wednesday at 8am Thursdays 11.15-11.45.

Its exhibits explain how oil and gas are created, disovered and produced, and what they are used for. The museum also provides informastion about technological advances and the way petroleum influences Norwegian society. Original objects, models, films and interactive exhibits illustrate everything from everyday life offshore to technology and dramatic incidents. The curious cat Petro serves as a guide through the museum's science centre.The museum was designed by architects Lunde & Løvseth, and is an attraction in itself. Its architecture is a scenographic interpretation of the Norwegian bedrock, the open coastal landscape and the offshore oil installations. Architechtural reviews have said that there is hardly a building in Norway which signals its function as obviously as the Norwegian Petroleum Museum. The museum was opened in 1999.","post@norskolje.museum.no","317602","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/23/f5/30/nom.jpg","Norway","false","58.97344",,"no","Norsk

Around 30,000 people make the trip up to the summit every year to enjoy the fantastic views from the top. On a clear day, you can see all the way south to the coast and east to Sweden. You can see one sixth of Norway from here. No matter what the weather is like, you can still buy a cup of coffee, waffles and food at the Tourist Association's 100-year-old stone cabin on the summit. You can pick your own stone from the piles around the summit and get it stamped to prove that you climbed the mountain. A new alpine slope down Gaustatoppen is planned, but this is no new idea. Had it not been for the Second World War, the alpine disciplines at the 1940 World Championships would have been arranged here.",,"3504730","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/01/c9/19/gaustatoppen-set-fra.jpg","Norway","false","59.854214",,"no","Gaustatoppen","Rjukan, Tinn Municipality, Telemark, Eastern Norway","8.64917","Gaustatoppen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"338",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"515","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/50/fc/c6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/64/c9/13/20190716-142847-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/3f/cb/ba/uitzicht.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/aa/74/d4/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/79/40/c2/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/3b/c8/00/photo3jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/27/35/63/received-10212656032531731.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/f2/04/7f/location-location-location.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/dc/fa/55/view.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/62/e2/9d/svett.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/c6/03/06/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/c6/03/05/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/71/dd/8b/veldig-fin-blomst-lagt.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/e2/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/dd/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/db/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/da/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/d9/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/d7/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/45/5d/c2/gaustatoppen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1e/9a/c4/58/it-comes-some-light-up.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/9e/f3/1f/photo3jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/9e/f3/1e/photo2jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/9e/f3/1d/photo1jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/9e/f3/1c/photo0jpg.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"18","2","#2 of 18 things to do in Rjukan","4.5","2","1","20","83","232","4.091109275817871",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nature & Parks",,,,"Mountains",,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g616206-d3504730-Reviews-Gaustatoppen-Rjukan_Tinn_Municipality_Telemark_Eastern_Norway.html","https://www.visitnorway.com/listings/rjukan/190608/"

Cod are particularly under threat and MUST be released, whereas some species may be kept. Fishing trips last for 3 hours. There is no open sea swell and after starting in 2007 not one person has been sick onboard. We fish using several methods: jigging, spinning, casting, trolling. We have two boats: -Matteo from 2019, 23ft long, with 200hp Mercury engine, takes 6 guests. Perfect for either a lower budget trip together with other guests, or a private trip for your group alone. -Victoria, from 2017, 30ft with 2 x 250hp Mercury engines takes up to 10 guests.

Our adventure starts with a convenient pickup in the city center.  We'll first visit the Steindalsfossen waterfalls, allowing you to experience the unique thrill of walking behind a waterfall.  Next, enjoy stunning fjord views during the 20-minute ferry crossing.  The tour's highlights start with an easy hike through the National Park during which you will be surrounded by natural beauty, from lush greenery and boulders to clear glacier waters.  Arriving at glacier lake Bondhusvatnet, you can relax, shoot pictures, or enjoy the snacks you brought.  The return journey includes another ferry ride, showcasing another part of the Hardangerfjord, followed by a bus ride through the countryside of Vestland, in which we will make multiple photo stops.

See the original balsa wood raft from 1947 and the Oscar-winning film from 1951! The museum houses original boats and artifacts from Thor Heyerdahl's world-famous expeditions such as the original Kon-Tiki balsa raft which crossed the Pacific Ocean in 1947 and the original reed boat Ra II which crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1970. Both exhibitions have separate children storylines. The Kon-Tiki Museum also houses one of the most comprehensive exhibitions about Easter Island in the world, including a replica of a family cave from Easter Island. Underneath the Kon-Tiki raft is a special underwater exhibit that is fun for kids. Cinema screening the original Kon-Tiki documentary movie (Oscar for best documentary in 1951) every day at 12:00. Great museum shop. Free with Oslo Pass.

Det vesle steinplatået er en del av den vestlige avslutningen av Hardangervidda og ble formet av isen som dekket store deler av Skandinavia gjennom flere istider. Turen opp til Trolltunga (1180 moh.) går for det meste i høyfjellsterreng og er lang og krevende. Men du får lønn for strevet – der oppe venter en praktfull utsikt. Fra hovedstartpunktet ved P2 i Skjeggedal har du en 27 km rundtur med en høydeforskjell på nesten 800 meter. Estimert gangtid er 8–12 timer. Du kan også starte fra P3 Mågelitopp. Derfra er rundturen 20 km og høydeforskjellen omtrent 320 meter. Estimert gangtid er 7–10 timer. Turgåere må være i god fysisk form og ha skikkelig utstyr.","aase@trolltunga.com","3522548","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/1b/98/8a/6f/fjord-norge.jpg","Norway","false","60.13269",,"no","Trolltunga","Odda, Hardanger, Hordaland,

Flexibility to Find Clear Skies – Our route adapts based on weather conditions, sometimes taking us inland, along the coast, or even into Finland to maximize the chances of seeing the aurora.  Transparency About Challenges – We prioritize finding clear skies over scenic locations due to increased road traffic. Stops may be alongside roads, but our goal is to provide the best possible view of the Northern Lights.  Comfort with Realistic Expectations – The bus offers warmth, though it may cool down on particularly cold nights. Guests are encouraged to dress in warm layers for added comfort.

The Sognefjord has a maximum depth of 1308 metres (4300 feet), and is Norway’s deepest fjord. You can choose between different boat trips to experience the beauty of the fjords all year round. At the mouth of the fjord the climate is maritime, whereas the innermost parts of the fjord have a much drier inland climate. Because of the contact with the warm ocean water of the Gulf Stream, the main fjord never freezes to ice. The Sognefjord has several distinctive fjord arms winding their way between steep mountains to end in small, picturesque villages. One of them is the world-famous Naeroyfjord, which has now been included on UNESCO's World Heritage List. This is the most narrow fjord arm. The innermost fjord arm is the Lusterfjord, and this fjord has a beautiful green colour because of the meltwater from the glaciers. Some places along the Sognefjord the difference in altitude between the highest mountain peak and the lowest point in the fjord is about 3000 metres (9800 feet). Fjords represent a unique landscape that is found in only a few places in the world. A common definition of a fjord is a long and narrow inlet of sea often surrounded by high and steep mountainsides. Some 20 000 years ago the fjord was shaped and formed by glacial ice in river valleys.",,"1816063","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/0c/d8/d0/uitzicht.jpg","Norway","false","60.942333",,"no","Sognefjorden","Sogn og Fjordane, Western
