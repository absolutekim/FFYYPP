There are two exciting tour options, the Northern Exposure and Southern Lights, and each Ocean Rafting day includes an exhilarating ride to Whitehaven Beach, pristine snorkelling reefs and guided Whitsunday Island National Parks walks. Ocean Rafting is the only tour to have direct access to the stunning and iconic Hill Inlet beach, and special snorkel sites at Hook Island and Border Island ensure a memorable underwater experience.The semi rigid inflatable vessels are super fast allowing guests to experience a fun ride, adventure and education amongst the natural beauty of the Whitsundays. The vessels were originally designed and built as rescue crafts and are driven by 450hp engines. 70% of the vessel is shaded, providing comfort from the tropical sun. Small groups allow guests to experience tropical paradise away from the crowds.Ocean Rafting has been operating since 1997 and is proud to have special permits allowing its vessels to visit protected areas in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The Skipper and Eco Host will ensure guests have a fun filled adventure and personalised service, from the courtesy bus pick up in the morning to snorkel lessons and a guided National Park walk in the Whitsunday Islands.","tours@oceanrafting.com.au","2075465","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1b/3c/c4/a8/enjoy-the-rush-of-our.jpg","Australia",,"-20.263924","Shingley Drive, Coral

Learn of the extraordinary efforts made by local miners who volunteered their time during construction. Explore the four tunnels, fitted out to resemble the 1942 original layout. Step inside the heritage-listed Tent House, a solution to the 1930s housing shortage in Mount Isa during the early mining boom years. Find out how a common tent was converted into a Tent House; an adaptation of materials to suit a hot, dry climate. The building currently housing the Beth Anderson Museum has a story of its own. It began life as a hospital in Kuridala, a heritage-listed abandoned mining town in the Cloncurry Shire. The Kuridala Hospital was purchased by the Mount Isa Hospital Committee for £400 for removal to the Mount Isa Hospital Reserve in July 1931. It was dismantled and transported to Mount Isa. Today, visitors to the Beth Anderson Museum can view an impressive collection of antique medical equipment.","info@undergroundhospital.com","4366249","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/22/db/49/23/underground-hospital.jpg","Australia",,"-20.730965","63 Deighton Street, 4825","en-AU","Underground Hospital and Museum","Mount Isa, Queensland","139.4946","Underground Hospital and Museum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"390",,"$0.11",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/10/61/f5/80.jpg",,"Viator","$15.95","Cultural Tours","400788P1","$16","Mount Isa Underground Hospital and Museum","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FQueensland%2FMount-Isa-Underground-Hospital-and-Museum%2Fd122-400788P1%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=7c5d309475f2cf31d&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=4366249&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+61 7 4749 3087","171","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/22/db/49/23/underground-hospital.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/27/0d/ab/furphy-water-cart.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/22/db/48/20/fairweather-tent-house.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/22/db/47/ba/fairweather-tent-house.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/22/db/47/b9/fairweather-tent-house.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/22/db/47/b7/beth-anderson-museum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/22/d5/ec/e3/beth-anderson-museum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/08/79/05/museum-and-entrance.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/88/27/36/20190728-120833-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/77/ef/94/underground-hospital.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/02/05/1f/img-20160425-115928-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3a/6f/50/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3a/6f/4f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3a/6f/4e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3a/1f/4a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3a/1f/49/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3a/1f/48/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3a/1f/47/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/3a/1f/46/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/a0/23/79/underground-hospital.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/a2/d6/24/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/97/94/d1/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/97/94/d0/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/97/94/cf/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"12","2","#2 of 12 things to do in Mount Isa","4.5","2","4","8","63","313","4.402309894561768","40","tent house","15","well worth a visit","4","history preserved","4","great history","8","on display","3","volunteer guides","3","world war","7","above ground","10","guided tour","5","interesting place","3","enjoyed our visit","3","early days","3","little gem","6","biscuits","3","wonderful tour","4","great guide","3","visiting mt","39","aubrey","17","medical","12","japanese","12","ww2","12","restored","12","bombing","9","nurse","6","instruments","6","ward","6","beds","6","threat","16","equipment","32","isa","Sights & Landmarks","Museums",,,,"Specialty Museums","Historic Sites",,,,,,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255339-d4366249-Reviews-Underground_Hospital_and_Museum-Mount_Isa_Queensland.html","http://www.undergroundhospital.com.au"

The boat it is nice and quiet and there are no petrol fumes or exhaust , it is also good for getting close to the wildlife without disturbing it. We aim to treat this fragile ecosystem with respect and have minimal impact, our boat does not create a wake so we do not erode the mangroves. We are the only boat with ""Croc Cam""; a digital video with a very good zoom for showing hard to see animals on a big screen.

Our aim is simple : to give each and every one of our customers one of the best tours they have ever been on. Because we own and operate our own spotter plane to find you whalesharks to swim with, for the last 10 years our guests have spent longer actually swimming with a whaleshark than guests on any other tour. (And isn't that why you go on a whaleshark tour in the first place?)","info@ningaloowhalesharks.com","4231949","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/19/4f/58/60/ningaloo-whaleshark-swim.jpg","Australia","false","-21.930258","31 Maidstone Cres, Shops 4 and 5, 6707","en-AU","Ningaloo Whaleshark Swim","Exmouth, Western Australia","114.12231","Ningaloo Whaleshark Swim",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1293",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+61 8 9949 4777","598","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/4f/58/60/ningaloo-whaleshark-swim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5b/a3/ef/its-a-simply-amazing.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5b/a3/a9/just-about-anyone-can.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5b/a3/a8/guests-playing-on-the.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5b/a3/a3/the-waters-of-the-ningaloo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5b/a3/a0/mantas-sometimes-find.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5b/a3/9e/nudibranchs-are-they.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5b/a2/9c/swim-with-a-humpback.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5b/a2/48/she-s-simply-the-best.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5b/a2/15/our-spotter-plane-finds.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5b/a1/a2/spotty-dotty-moments.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5b/a0/eb/in-water-encounter-with.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f9/6e/16/ningaloo-whaleshark-swim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f9/6e/13/ningaloo-whaleshark-swim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f9/6e/0e/ningaloo-whaleshark-swim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f9/6e/0d/ningaloo-whaleshark-swim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f9/6d/52/ningaloo-whaleshark-swim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f9/6d/4c/ningaloo-whaleshark-swim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f9/6d/46/ningaloo-whaleshark-swim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f9/6d/38/ningaloo-whaleshark-swim.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/69/31/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/69/30/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/69/2f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/69/2e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7e/69/2d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7d/15/58/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7d/15/57/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/7d/15/56/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/71/20/d8/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/6e/eb/fa/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/6e/eb/f9/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/6e/eb/f8/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/6e/eb/f7/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/6e/eb/f6/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"40","6","#6 of 40 Boat Tours & Water Sports in Exmouth","5","8","9","14","61","1201","4.410410404205322","116","spotter plane","84","humpback whales","26","photo package","78","these guys","63","bucket list","64","amazing experience","64","fish","28","end of the day","19","other companies","35","once in a lifetime","43","marine life","26","making sure","24","food was great","17","highly recommend this company","11","whole team","11","tiger shark","11","salad","63","sian","19","davey","143","swims","485","crew","115","board","261","boat","257","water","27","volunteers","27","pete","83","ningaloo","54","safety","16","jaz","57","ocean","Tours","Boat Tours & Water Sports","Outdoor Activities",,,"Scuba & Snorkeling","Shark Diving","Boat Tours","Eco Tours","Dolphin & Whale Watching",,,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g488342-d4231949-Reviews-Ningaloo_Whaleshark_Swim-Exmouth_Western_Australia.html","http://www.ningaloowhalesharks.com"

From August - October we offer the opportunity to swim with Humpback Whales in their natural environment. Both tours offer an extraordinary experience, one not to be taken for granted, and as such is conducted purely on the animals own terms. Whale sharks and humpback whales can be very inquisitive creatures and it is quite possible they will seek interaction with humans and swim close to us.

Played in groups of 2, 3 or 4 players where each player has their own dedicated room - you will join each other in the virtual world where you can talk to each other, walk around, bend, throw objects and collaborate to solve the mission. With 3 missions to choose from, you and your team of 2-4 players will travel back to historical periods of time such as ancient Egypt and the moon landing to solve the challenges and save the world!

The huge saltwater jumping crocodiles are the stars of this fascinating 1 hour cruise, which excites, entertains and educates. Crocodiles can be seen caged anywhere, but this may be your only chance to see the Famous Jumping Crocodiles 'in Action in the Wild'. Perched high above the dangers of the crocodiles is a feast of birdlife – white belly sea eagles, magpie, geese, brolgas, spritely dollar birds and hawks (known as kites in the NT). Kingfishers and corellas gather in flocks of hundreds on the marshy floodplains beside the river. Wild pigs and buffalo are often sighted darting in and out of the tall grasses along the river banks.","admin@jumpingcrocodilecruises.com.au","1066871","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/71/ac/81/entrance.jpg","Australia","false","-12.660148","3220A Arnhem Highway Wak Wak, At

Currently we are concentrating on small group private tours to the Hunter Valley (wine) and really anywhere that you and your group may wish. We are very flexible and priced well. Transfers to/from anywhere. Day trips or multiday trips. Be sure to shoot over an email or give us a call.

The Fullerton Hotel presents ‘The GPO Heritage Tour’. Our guides will share our history from the early days of the Sydney Cove settlement and the turning point of the colony when the GPO opened in 1874. The Sydney GPO was our message to the world that commerce in the Colony of New South Wales was alive and thriving. Our guides will take you to the excavations of the fresh water spring known as the Tank Stream and explore the design intention and location of what was to become the Sydney GPO. The tour takes in everything from Victorian grandeur to lost treasures. Visit the stables, mail sorting rooms, lost letter room, grand staircase, telegraph room that connected us to the world, telephone exchange, banking room, Britannia, Little Brother, the Clocktower and 5t hour bell, Barnett’s much ado about ogling and the wonderful stories behind the decorative carvings.","fsy.info@fullertonhotels.com","20059202","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/23/87/2c/d0/the-gpo-belltower-the.jpg","Australia","false","-33.86784","No. 1 Martin Place,

During winter from May to October whales can be spotted but dolphins and seals can be seen all year round. Situated in Princess Royal Harbour, part of King George Sound, these waters are steeped in history. Come aboard and experience Albany from the sea. Imagine what it would have been like when the first explorers pulled into the harbour as early as 1627 or when the first ANZAC troops departed Albany for WWI in 1914. Our boat is the ""Young Salty Dog"", a twin hull catamaran and an ex Sea Rescue vessel that is safe and stable. Holding up to 12 passengers, Captain Mark will give you a personalised tour of the harbour and King George Sound.
