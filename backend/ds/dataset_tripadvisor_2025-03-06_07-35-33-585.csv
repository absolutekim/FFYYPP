Start your tour of Coyoacan at the lively Jardin Centenario park which is surrounded by inviting cafes and townhouses. Then, set off to visit the Frida Kahlo Museum that is dedicated to the life and works of the Mexican artist herself. On the way there, pop by the artisans market to hunt for handmade keepsakes and visit the Coyoacan Market for fresh tostadas and gorditas. For a full experience, take a guided tour around Coyoacan, which includes a visit to the floating gardens of neighboring Xochimilco. –

The palace houses the National Museum of History, which showcases impressive murals and stunning stained glass galleries. You can also take a leisurely stroll through the castle's manicured gardens and enjoy the panoramic views of downtown. Make sure to set aside enough time to relax and enjoy the sprawling Chapultepec Park nearby, too. Take a guided tour to learn about the building's rich history, and consider visiting on a tour that also includes the nearby National Museum of Anthropology.

It’s easy to spot hand-embroidered pillow covers, colorful Otomi textiles, and pre-Columbian clay artworks. The intricate lacquerware and Lucha libre shirts—not your typical souvenir staples—also make great gifts. Plus, you won’t have to travel to Oaxaca or Chihuahua, as the items here are brought in from all over Mexico. When it’s meal time, break up your shopping and recharge at the cantina in the middle of the market.

Mexican people build small altars in their homes with fruit, food, flowers, and small articles that belonged to their loved ones in the belief that they will come from the afterlife to visit them. Sugar skulls are decorated and sold in the markets — and traditional towns, such as Aguascalientes, hold  a 'desfile,' or Day of the Dead procession, attended by over 75,000 people that incorporates

Built in the late 1920s, this renovated Art Deco building provides the perfect environment for relaxation and could serve as a “sanctuary” from all the surrounding buzz of the big metropolitan city thanks to its peaceful atmosphere and greenery planted everywhere. On the third floor of the building is a modern boutique B&B which adds to the gallery’s unique vibe. Last but not least, Barrio Alameda has a large rooftop terrace restaurant from where you can watch Mexico City’s skyline with Alameda Central, the first public park in the Americas, in front, or just

The gardens, or chinampas, were constructed by the Aztecs from juniper branches, allowing them to grow crops on the little man-made islands. Today, you can journey down the Xochimilco canals formed by these islands in colorful trajinera boats. Trajineras can be booked per hour at the Embarcadero Nuevo Nativitas, each with its own personal name. Weekends tend to be busier, with drinking and celebration common, while weekdays are more family-friendly. –
