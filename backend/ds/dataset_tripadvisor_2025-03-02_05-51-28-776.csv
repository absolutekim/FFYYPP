It is called ""Hakuro-jo"" (White Heron Castle) because of its brilliant white exterior and supposed resemblance to a white heron taking flight. Q1. Can I use a credit card? A1. Yes, you can. We accept major credit cards like VISA, MasterCard, AMEX, Diners and JCB. Q2. Do you have a coin operated locker? A2. Yes we do, but the number and kind of them are limited, so you had better use the ones in Himeji station. The biggest size is 1135H x 350W x 640D(mm). Q3. When is peak season? A3. Our peak is usually around late March to early April for cherry blossoms, late April to early May for Japanese Holiday Season so called 'Golden Week', and October and November for travel season for Japanese. Q4. When do I have to arrive to avoid congestion? A4. 15 to 30 minutes prior to opening time (9am (8am-8:30am for peak season)). Q5. How long does it take to walk around the castle? A5. Normally, it takes at least 90 minutes to explore the castle, but you can try to go up and down with no stop in 45 minutes.",,"320231","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/17/be/25/87/photo0jpg.jpg","Japan",,"34.83831","〒670-0012本町68","ja","姫路城","Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, Kinki","134.6927","Himeji

Therefore, the image and history of Ninja are vague and filled with mystery. However, in almost every famous war, Ninjas were spoken to have played a big role in the battle. It was Ninja’s flawless sneak missions that led the then-smaller Samurai feudal lords to great victory. In most of the legendary battles in history where the army ran short in number, Ninja would sneak into the enemy's base and cause their army to fail. Sanada Masayuki was the well-known example of the warlords who were also a great coordinator of the Ninja unit. The Sanada clan, despite its army merely being of 2,000 soldiers, has defeated the Tokugawa clan whose soldiers nearly counted 8,000. Ninja Weapon Museum is the place where we exhibit many kinds Ninja's weapons as well as historical weapons such as Samurai swords. It is our mission to share the authentic history of Ninja and ancient Japanese weapons.","info@ninjaweaponmuseum.jp","23509055","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1d/c0/9f/a5/the-entrance-of-ninja.jpg","Japan",,"36.557316",,"ja","忍者武器ミュージアム","Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, Hokuriku, Chubu","136.64749","Ninja Weapon Museum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"710",,"$0.01",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/15/51/f8/86.jpg",,"Viator","$90.67","Cultural Tours","5556437P1","$91","Private Bespoke Kanazawa Walking Tour","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FIshikawa-Prefecture%2FKanazawas-Heritage-Meets-Bespoke-Experience-Private-479-Hrs%2Fd50161-5556437P1%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=ee0c69e7182479fa7&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=23509055&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/12/37/84/04.jpg",,"Viator","$172.92","Cultural Tours","9582P75","$173","Day Tour from Kanazawa: Gold Leaf, Japanese Sweets and Ninja Star","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FIshikawa-Prefecture%2FDay-Tour-from-Kanazawa-Gold-Leaf-Japanese-Sweets-and-Ninja-Star%2Fd50161-9582P75%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=dd45e29c0ed76b2d4&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=2&cnt=1&geo=23509055&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+81 76-245-6450","542","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/c0/9f/a5/the-entrance-of-ninja.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/c3/54/ed/ninja-weapon-museum.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/a0/df/72/the-entrance-of-ninja.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/03/e5/9d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/03/e5/9c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/03/e5/9b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/bb/21/af/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/b9/6b/d6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/b9/6b/d5/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/22/a6/a1/df/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/7b/da/03/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/6a/61/c6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/6a/61/c5/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/64/d4/71/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/63/91/20/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/63/91/1f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/63/91/1e/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/58/5e/c6/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/55/e0/95/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/55/e0/94/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"392","1","#1 of 392 things to do in Kanazawa","5","2","1","1","23","683","4.476759910583496","4","super fun","3","guided tour in english","4","interesting collection","2","cute gift shop","2","speak good english","2","real weapons","2","concealed weapons","2","private collection","4","japanese history","3","a lot of fun","2","small fee","2","interesting place","4","on display","3","second floor","2","well worth a visit","49","throwing","5","replica","3","darts","2","spikes","2","warfare","5","armour","6","artifacts","4","tools","5","souvenirs","2","armory","4","chaya","2","activity","2","skills","4","explanation","2","stories","Museums",,,,,,"Specialty Museums",,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298115-d23509055-Reviews-Ninja_Weapon_Museum-Kanazawa_Ishikawa_Prefecture_Hokuriku_Chubu.html","http://www.ninjaweaponmuseum.jp/en"

At the beginning of the Heian period (794-1192), the temple building was washed away when the Kamo River flooded. The temple was reestablished by Senkan Naigu (918-984), a priest of the Tendai sect, and became a branch of Enryakuji, the Tendai temple complex on Mt. Hiei. Over a period of three years beginning in 1922, the temple was transfered to its present location in the Saga District, in order to preserve it. The temple has a wonderful array of 1,200 carved stone figures of Rakan (disciples of Shaka, the founder of Buddhism) made by people from various parts of the country from 1981 to 1991 for the reconstruction of the temple.","1200rakan@otagiji.com","1386143","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/1b/a3/84/just-a-fraction-of-the.jpg","Japan","false","35.031265","〒616-8439右京区嵯峨鳥居本深谷町2-5","ja","愛宕念仏寺","Kyoto,

The park area covers three prefectures, which are Fukushima, Tochigi and Gunma with a total area of 114,908 ha. Most of the park area is a mountainous area belonging to the Nasu volcanic belt and is spread into the following mountains: Mt. Shirane (Mt. Nikko-Shirane) with an altitude of 2,578 m which is the highest mountain in the North Kanto, Mt. Nantai with an altitude of 2,486 m which is known as a sacred mountain from the ancient times, and Mt. Chausu (Mt. Nasu) with an altitude of 1,917 m which is still an active volcano. Further, plateaus spread at the foot of these mountains, to which crater lakes, impressive waterfalls and gorges with beautiful autumn leaves add colors. Meanwhile, a perfect fusion of several historic buildings including shrines and temples registered as the World Cultural Heritage sites and the surrounding natural landscapes can be appreciated.","REO-KANTO@env.go.jp","548085","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/98/47/53/nikko-national-park.jpg","Japan","false","36.89363",,"ja","日光国立公園","Nikko, Tochigi Prefecture, Kanto","139.63441","Nikko National Park",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"402",,"$0.01",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/12/4a/00/56.jpg",,"Viator","$210.49","Cultural Tours","92136P52","$211","Nikko Full-Day Private Walking Tour with Government-Licensed Guide (Tokyo DEP.)

Monks who visited China to learn Buddhism discovered tea and they brought back tea seed to Japan and started to grow tea plants. Tea drinking became popular and out of this habit the practice of the Japanese Tea Ceremony evolved. There is nothing else available in Kyoto other than a few other Tea Rooms which are set in the grounds of Temples and Shrines and are, for obvious reasons, closed to the general public from Japan and overseas, other than on very special and rare occasions.If you are looking to experience the Japanese Tea Ceremony in its true spirit then there is nothing else better in Kyoto than the Tea Ceremony Juan located in the grounds of the Jotokuji temple.","teaceremonykyoto@gmail.com","4402176","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/02/51/c1/getlstd-property-photo.jpg","Japan","false","34.99533","〒600-8119下京区烏丸通七条下る東塩小路町 709旅館 銀閣","ja","茶室 聚庵","Kyoto, Kyoto Prefecture, Kinki","135.76419","Tea Ceremony Juan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"8277483","Shimogyo-ku",,,"695",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+81 90-1138-4480","235","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/4e/6a/99/tea-ceremony-juan.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/02/51/c1/getlstd-property-photo.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/15/65/17/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/2b/72/33/the-tea-ceremony-room.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/15/65/23/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/15/65/1d/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/15/62/c3/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/12/3d/c6/tea-ceremony-workshop.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/19/08/3e/tea-ceremony-sweets.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f2/bf/d7/20191223-160851-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/57/28/9e/photo0jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/d0/a6/1c/photo6jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/d0/a6/1b/photo5jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/d0/a6/1a/photo4jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/d0/a6/19/photo3jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/d0/a6/18/photo2jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/d0/a6/17/photo1jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/d0/a6/16/photo0jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/c2/98/06/photo0jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/35/a1/90/20190402-180923-largejpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d1/7f/35/japanese-tea-ceremony.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d1/7f/34/japanese-tea-ceremony.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d1/7f/33/japanese-tea-ceremony.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d1/7f/32/japanese-tea-ceremony.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/d1/7f/31/japanese-tea-ceremony.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/91/5e/84/japanese-tea-ceremony.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/91/5e/81/japanese-tea-ceremony.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/91/5e/80/japanese-tea-ceremony.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/91/5e/7d/japanese-tea-ceremony.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/91/5e/66/japanese-tea-ceremony.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"409","17","#17 of 409 Classes & Workshops in Kyoto","5","1","2","6","64","622","4.334932804107666","5","importance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Classes & Workshops",,,,,,"Lessons & Workshops",,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298564-d4402176-Reviews-Tea_Ceremony_Juan-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html","http://www.teaceremonyjuan.com/"

We are located in a traditional 100-year-old machiya townhouse, sitting in the heart of Kyoto's legendary Gion district. The most famous home of the maiko in all of Japan surrounded by traditional restaurants, ryokans, tea houses, shrines and more.
