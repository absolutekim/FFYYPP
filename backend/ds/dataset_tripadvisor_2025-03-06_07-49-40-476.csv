The museum houses a unique collection comprising over 4000 works of art, mostly post-1900, by Danish and foreign artists. The exhibition area consists of five galleries providing visitors with ample opportunity to experience the permanent collection as well as a number of special exhibitions. Kunsten also hosts a variety of events including lectures, film screenings, concerts, family workshops, guided tours, and other activities suitable for all age groups. The museum building, completed in 1972, is an attraction in its own right. Designed by the world-famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, assisted by Elissa Aalto and Jean-Jacques Baruel, it is the only museum building outside Finland designed by Aalto. The museum is built of striking white marble, a style that is continued inside with stunning marble flooring and copper lamps, also designed by Aalto.","kunsten@kunsten.dk","243826","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/04/9d/21/f2/nordjyllands-kunstmuseet.jpg","Denmark","false","57.042824",,"da","Kunsten Museum of Modern Art Aalborg","Aalborg, North Jutland, Jutland","9.905822","Kunsten Museum of Modern Art Aalborg","Aalborg, Denmark","0.4211048451280762","57.04291915893555",,,,,,,,,,,,,"","Aalborg Station","9.917011260986328","Aalborg Station",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"219",,"$2.59",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/0a/fb/d2/f3.jpg",,"Viator","$237.17","Cultural Tours","198694P14","$238","Aalborg Historical Treasures: A Walking Tour","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FAalborg%2FThe-best-of-Aalborg-walking-tour%2Fd4186-198694P14%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=ff88fffb79482f2d5&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=243826&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+45 99 82 41 00","194","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/f6/93/a9/cobra.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/7d/9c/90/brasserie-kunsten.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/7d/9c/7d/our-friendly-staff-is.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/7d/9c/79/guided-exhibition-tour.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/7d/9c/77/guided-tours-knows-no.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/7d/9c/71/shop-unique-local-design.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/7d/9c/5f/brasserie-kunsten.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/7d/9c/5e/brasserie-kunsten.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/7d/9c/5b/shop-unique-local-design.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/35/76/a7/sidelyssalene-og-trampedach.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/35/76/a5/fotograf-montgomerydk.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/35/76/a4/fotograf-montgomerydk.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/35/76/a3/kunsten-taet-pa-fotograf.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/35/76/a2/cafe-aalto-fotograf-louise.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/35/76/a1/fotograf-louise-dybro.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/9d/21/fb/nordjyllands-kunstmuseet.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/9d/21/f2/nordjyllands-kunstmuseet.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d2/62/72/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/d2/62/71/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/81/0e/88/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/81/0e/87/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/81/0e/86/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/81/0e/85/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/81/0e/84/caption.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"162","3","#3 of 162 things to do in Aalborg","4.5","1","8","19","76","115","3.698652744293213","5","alvar aalto","2","sculpture garden","3","beautiful building","5","exhibits","2","insight",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sights & Landmarks","Museums",,,,,"Art Museums","Architectural Buildings",,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189529-d243826-Reviews-Kunsten_Museum_of_Modern_Art_Aalborg-Aalborg_North_Jutland_Jutland.html","http://www.kunsten.dk/"

Doors open into a world that up to now has been hidden from most of us. Here, we learn some of the stories surrounding the many people who lived on the dark side of society: the poor, the sick and the homeless who lived here, whether briefly or long-term, during the 102 years when the Poorhouse operated. Traces of the hardness of their lives are everywhere. The Welfare Museum conveys to the visitor a feeling of the past that creeps under the skin.","info@museumsydfyn.dk","243808","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1c/be/6f/16/et-kig-ind-i-forsorgelsesafdel.jpg","Denmark","false","55.06214",,"da","Danmarks Forsorgsmuseum","Svendborg, Funen and Islands","10.603412","Danmarks Forsorgsmuseum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"73",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+45 62 21 02 61","91","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/be/6f/16/et-kig-ind-i-forsorgelsesafdel.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/8f/f1/fd/i-1974-lukkede-fattiggarden.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/8f/f1/fb/i-1974-lukkede-fattiggarden.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1e/11/d2/40/stemningsbillede-fra.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1e/11/ca/5f/stemningsbillede-fra.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/be/6f/3d/vaskerummet-fra-1872.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/be/6f/25/stemningsbillede-fra.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/be/6f/23/oplev-opsynsmandens-lejlighed.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/be/6f/18/kom-ind-bag-murene-pa.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/be/6e/98/vaskerummet-pa-danmarks.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/d8/45/db/viebaeltegard.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/eb/6f/f8/viebaeltegard.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/d8/45/ea/viebaeltegard.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/d8/45/e3/viebaeltegard.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/08/7e/90/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/08/7e/8f/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/08/7e/8c/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/08/7e/8b/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/08/7e/8a/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/fb/5d/49/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/fb/5d/48/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/fb/5d/47/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/fb/5d/46/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/fb/5d/45/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/b6/3b/c9/forsorgsmuseet-welfare.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"116","3","#3 of 116 things to do in Svendborg","4.5","0","2","4","17","50","3.3535122871398926",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Museums",,,,,,"Specialty Museums","History Museums",,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189525-d243808-Reviews-Danmarks_Forsorgsmuseum-Svendborg_Funen_and_Islands.html","http://forsorgsmuseet.dk/"

In Christian VIII’s Palace the museum offers an insight into royal life past and present. You can see the private chambers of former kings and queens and, on most days, there is also admittance to the royal reception rooms (check periods at our website) from the museum. In Christian VII’s Palace you can walk in the footsteps of the royal guests, and be shown round the magnificent rooms where grand festivities are held. You can book a guided tour of Christian VII’s Palace in the ticket office of Christian VIII’s Palace or on our website. Remember that every day at noon you can watch the changing of the The Royal Danish Life

You meet curious lemurs, cheeky squirrel monkeys, and many other monkey species.","info@reepark.dk","2173065","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/6b/d5/48/gepardmor-med-unger.jpg","Denmark","false","56.26297",,"da","Ree Park Safari","Ebeltoft, Southdjurs Municipality, East Jutland, Jutland","10.738135","Ree Park Safari",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"669",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+45 86 33 61 50","783","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/e9/ae/23/giraffer-pa-savannen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/46/eb/6a/tag-turen-ad-den-lange.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/46/ea/29/i-ree-park-safari-kan.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/46/e8/49/tag-med-amerika-expressen.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/46/e8/44/tag-pa-landrover-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f7/e5/02/ree-park-ebeltoft-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f7/e4/d8/ree-park-ebeltoft-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f7/e4/c3/ree-park-ebeltoft-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f7/e4/bf/ree-park-ebeltoft-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/f7/e4/b5/ree-park-ebeltoft-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/f4/04/08/bizons-are-hungry.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/d7/a4/fc/photo0jpg.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/a5/1e/32/ree-park-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/f6/5b/e5/ree-park-ebeltoft-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/4b/0d/6b/pet-a-pig.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/f4/04/06/hello-mr-moose.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/f4/04/0a/the-savanna.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/f4/04/0c/the-lions-are-sated.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/f4/04/0e/lovely-playground.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/9a/24/ae/caption.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/6e/2a/da/ree-park-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/6e/2a/c4/ree-park-safari.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/7d/fa/3b/ree-park-safari.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","1","#1 of 3 Nature & Parks in Ebeltoft","4.5","18","19","54","220","358","3.847270965576172","7","train ride","4","animal welfare","3","bring your own","3","children aged","2","toilet facilities","2","catering facilities","2","high season","2","lion cubs","3","black beans","89","animals","28","zoo","13","space","7","nature","2","landrover","2","cheetas","2","cabin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zoos & Aquariums","Water & Amusement Parks","Nature & Parks","Outdoor Activities",,,"Zoos","Theme Parks","Safaris",,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g230028-d2173065-Reviews-Ree_Park_Safari-Ebeltoft_Southdjurs_Municipality_East_Jutland_Jutland.html","http://www.reepark.dk"

Trapholt opened in 1988 and added additional exhibition space and collection storage in 1996. The international architecture competition held in 1982, was won by the project team of architects Boje Lundgaard and Bente Aude, lighting designer Sophus Frandsen and landscape architect Svend Kirkegaard, for its exceptional museum design and its extraordinary and sensitive placement in nature. The Museum is set in a beautiful sculpture park overlooking the water of Kolding Fjord and visitors come from far and near, not only to see the amazing array of exhibitions, performances and programs but also to experience the museum’s architecture, the one-of-a-kind summerhouse designed by Arne Jacobsen, to find unique design treasures in the museum shop and to become culinarily tempted in the restaurant with its breathtaking view. At Trapholt visitors will be welcomed by TRAPguides that are trained to help assist and offer the visitors guided tours of the museum, tours of Arne Jacobsen’s summerhouse, and introductions to current exhibitions. Also at Trapholt, we make sure to always have a varied range of options and activities for children and their accompanying adults. Trapholt Exhibitions Trapholt displays a series of permanent and temporary exhibitions throughout the year. Trapholt’s goal is, at any given time, to display exhibitions of three different categories within its expertise; namely aesthetically enticing displays, current, debate creating exhibits and compelling insights into design and art history. Trapholt has a total of 2500 square meters of exhibition space divided into 8 galleries. Unique for the architectural design of the museum, is that not only does some galleries have breathtaking views, but each and every gallery has its own specific character and is unique in regards to the layout, daylight/artificial light and orientation. All galleries are accessible from the main museum walkway that winds it way down the sloped terrains and gives access to all the exhibitions. The whole museum, and all the facilities, are designed to be wheelchair accessible . The Trapholt Collections Trapholt collections consists of: A large collection of Danish furniture design Modern Danish visual art and sculpture A permanent Richard Mortensen exhibition Ceramics, textiles and product designs The sculpture park, with works by Danish contemporary artists The Arne Jacobsen’s Cube flex summerhouse The collection of Danish visual arts and sculpture, is mainly from the 19th century up until today. The bulk of the collection however, dates from after 1900 and in addition to art, the collection also includes crafts, and product designs from this period.

At each of the around 700 cremation graves from the Iron and Viking Ages, the dead body was burnt on location, and the graves were marked by stone circles. These stone circles are still visible in the landscape in one of Denmark’s best preserved ancient monuments. The story about the people who lived and died here is told inside the museum, which also houses an exhibition about ancient times in the Limfjorden area.

The Tower once soared far above the rest of the rooftops in the city, and University astronomers studied the stars and planets from the Observatory at the top. The scholars may have forsaken the building a long time ago, but during the winter visitors are still able to gaze at the cosmos from Europe's oldest functioning observatory. The platform that runs around the outside of the Observatory affords views over the old Latin Quarter – from here, you can spot most of the city's famous buildings. The Round Tower does not have an elevator, so visitors have to climb the winding, white-washed Spiral Walk, where kids often hide in the niches, only to jump out shouting “boo!” as adults approach. Halfway up the tower is the entrance to the large and stunningly beautiful Library Hall, which now serves as a popular gallery and concert venue. It hosts several exhibitions a year, and stages concerts almost every week. Above the Library is the Bell Loft, notable for its enormous wooden beams, which were used in the reconstruction of the Tower following the great fire of Copenhagen in 1728. The Loft is also home to a small exhibition of fascinating artefacts from the Tower's history, including Christian IV's wax seal, a tin of medicine produced by Tycho Brahe, and a piece of the bomb that exploded in the Library Hall during the bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807.The Round Tower was built by Christian IV between 1637 and 1642. It was the first part of the Trinitatis Complex, which combined church, library and observatory in a single building.","post@rundetaarn.dk","207299","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0f/ab/82/46/rundetaarn-copenhagen.jpg","Denmark","false","55.681328",,"da","Rundetårn","Copenhagen,

The image of an Italian country villa was on the drawing board when Frederick IV began construction on his Baroque palace. The king wanted to create a haven where his family life could flourish. This Baroque masterpiece took seven years to complete, and during this time the gardens were also planted. When Frederick IV died, his son Christian VI pulled down wings of the palace and erected new ones, which he, albeit, generally never made use of. It was only when Christian IX came to the throne that the palace was used for the purpose for which it was built. In the summer months, Christian IX and his queen Louise's 6 children, their children's spouses and 36 grandchildren flocked to Fredensborg Palace. Laughter and the trip-trap of tiny feet echoed in the palace halls, and members of the Danish Royal Family would spend time playing in the gardens. Ever since those happy days, the Danish Royal Family has been moving into the palace for the summer months, giving the youngest members of the family a trove of carefree childhood memories to treasure. The Royal Couple use the palace for three months in the spring and three months in the autumn. They celebrate weddings, silver wedding anniversaries and birthdays at the palace. Fredensborg also provides a setting for Her Majesty to carry out her official duties. She receives heads of state and ambassadors who submit their credentials to her at the palace. In the summer, Crown Prince Frederick and Crown Princess Mary use the palace as a summer residence. They have their own residential quarters in the Chancellery House. The expansive Baroque palace gardens are open to the public all year round. The palace and the Private Gardens are open for guided tours from July 1st to August 7th.","fredensborg@slks.dk","7287903","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/18/03/4c/e4/dsc-0829-01-largejpg.jpg","Denmark","false","55.982414",,"da","Fredensborg Slot","Fredensborg, Fredensborg Municipality, Copenhagen Region, Zealand","12.395752","Fredensborg Palace",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"197",,"$1.26",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/10/97/d9/a9.jpg",,"Viator","$114.76","Cultural Tours","104357P189","$115","Private Custom Tour with a Local Guide in Helsingør","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FHelsingor%2FPrivate-custom-tour-with-a-local-guide-Helsingor%2Fd25614-104357P189%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=18095cee5ddbeb41f&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=7287903&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/07/36/bd/34.jpg",,"Viator","$121.79","Historical & Heritage Tours","68772P7","$122","Kings, Castles & Countryside Tour -

Denmark has one of the oldest monarchies in the world, and the palace has a long, dramatic history which revolves around the exercise of royal power. Today, Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. Under its beautiful copper roof, the palace houses the Danish parliament, the office of the Danish prime minister and the Supreme Court. It is therefore the center for legislative, executive and judicial power in Denmark. The palace also accommodates rooms for the Danish Monarchy. Focusing on the royal part of the palace, Christiansborg Palace is H.M. the Queen's working palace. This is where the Queen holds audiences, signs laws, holds banquets and receptions, celebrates royal anniversaries and receives state visits. It is a working palace where old traditions and the modern Royal Family meet. You will see dazzling halls, adorned with colorful tapestries, vast paintings, patterned floors, glittering chandeliers, and sumptuous stucco ceilings. You can explore The Royal Kitchen and see its two tons of shiny copper kitchenware. You can visit the beautiful palace chapel, stand underneath its dome and let your head spin as you gaze up at the angels in the ceiling décor more than 30 metres above you. In The Royal Stables you'll find the the white royal horses in the wintertime, and in the summertime the exhibition ""All the kings' horses"" - all year around you can see the Royal Family's array of carriages. One of them is coated with 24-carat gold leaf. You can also explore the underground ruins underneath Christiansborg Palace. These are ruins of earlier castles and palaces showing that the Castle Island is steeped in 800 years of power and political intrigue.","christiansborg@natmus.dk","207300","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/fd/b7/28/photo0jpg.jpg","Denmark","false","55.676445",,"da","Christiansborg Slot","Copenhagen, Zealand","12.580725","Christiansborg Slot","Kongens Nytorv 11, Copenhagen 1050, Denmark","0.2687387487619156","55.67942810058594","copenhagan-copenhagan-metro-m1","M1","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Copenhagan Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit","copenhagan-copenhagan-metro-m2","M2","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Copenhagan Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit","Kongens Nytorv 11, 1050","Kongens Nytorv","12.585139274597168","Kongens Nytorv","Christianshavns Torv 6, Copenhagen 1410, Denmark","0.49716155249560046","55.67219543457031","copenhagan-copenhagan-metro-m1","M1","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Copenhagan Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit","copenhagan-copenhagan-metro-m2","M2","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Copenhagan Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit","Christianshavns Torv 6, 1410","Christianshavn","12.591004371643066","Christianshavn","Frederiksborggade 13, Copenhagen 1360, Denmark","0.6138541190310758","55.68367004394531","copenhagan-copenhagan-metro-m1","M1","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Copenhagan Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit","copenhagan-copenhagan-metro-m2","M2","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Copenhagan Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit","Frederiksborggade 13, 1360","Nørreport","12.571584701538086","Norreport","Copenhagen, Denmark","0.6717879602520743","55.67280960083008",,,,,,,,,,,,,"","København Hovedbanegård Station","12.564753532409668","Kobenhavn Hovedbanegard Station","Njalsgade 70, Copenhagen 2300, Denmark","0.8996281432486677","55.663700103759766","copenhagan-copenhagan-metro-m1","M1","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Copenhagan Metro","https://static.tacdn.com/img/api/metro_stations/metro_placeholder.png","Rapid Transit",,,,,,,"Njalsgade 70, 2300","Islands Brygge","12.585322380065918","Islands Brygge","8623671","Indre By (Inner City)",,,,,"4807",,"$0.08",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/09/2d/b4/21.jpg",,"Viator","$7.99","Cultural Tours","110804P161","$8","Monstour: A Self-Guided Audio Tour of Danish Folk Legends","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FCopenhagen%2FMonstour-Discover-Danish-folk-legends-on-an-audio-walking-tour%2Fd463-110804P161%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=e9ae4d117846b7a75&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=207300&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true",,"https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-splice-spp-360x240/07/1c/fe/db.jpg",,"Viator","$95.96","Water Tours","59141P1","$96","Social Sailing -

It is situated in the heart of the city on Vor Frue Plads next to the main building of the University of Copenhagen.The church was designed by architect Christian Frederik Hansen in the neoclassical style and was completed in 1829.The church can seat more than 1100 people and is decorated with the twelve apostles, the Risen Christ and the baptismal fount in the form of an angel holding a large scallop shell, all in Italian carrara marble. These sculptures were completed in Rome by the famous Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen.In the aisles many portraits of bishops and deans are on display.Night Church thursdays, fridays and sundays evenings offers prayer, electronica, poetry, jazz, taizé, gospel workshop and other contemporary forms all in candle-lighting. The program varies but can be checked on the website.In the Church apse there is a small museum and boutique. Below the museum, a part of the Gothic foundation is preserved, and a short movie tells the dramatic story of the tower.",,"245969","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/2d/cc/0c/inside-the-church.jpg","Denmark","false","55.67928",,"da","Vor Frue Kirke - Københavns Domkirke","Copenhagen,

Eckersberg, J.Th. Lundbye and Christen Købke as well as artists from the modern period such as the famous Danish painters P.S. Krøyer, Anna Ancher and Vilhelm Hammershøi.
