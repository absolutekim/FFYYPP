One of Antoni Gaudi’s most famous works, the church is perhaps best known for still being under construction since 1882—with works funded purely by donations. Take a lift to the top of the towers for a panoramic view of the city and marvel at the ornate architecture. The nativity facade and crypt have also been awarded UNESCO World Heritage Status. Skip the line with a pre-booked tour with tower access, or combine your visit with another of Gaudi's work, Parc Guell. –

This extensive area is entirely involved in health, with a total of four seawater pools, including the dynamic pool, gym pool and the large Get in Shape Pool, which consists of a relaxing circuit of seawater heated to different temperatures (33ºC/37ºC) with 33 hydromassage points. This was the first large installation to open on the island of Gran Canaria specifically to provide services using seawater.

Besides the frequent signs offering directions to branching bus pick-up locations, it is highly encouraged, specially for the novel traveler, to avoid public transport (which requires knowledge of the Spanish language and being familiar with locations in order to request stops), and heading to the main entrance were Taxi Majorca cars are stationed. Taxi Majorca is an official private transport service operating for years in the island, allowing for easy Majorca airport transfers for foreigners, independently of it being from the airport to the nearby city of Palma de Mallorca, neigbouring towns or holiday resorts; or viceversa. Our customers enjoy new cars, adequately conditioned to maximize passenger comfort, a professional driver, and a clean and fast service, extremely time efficient. Stop wasting time in your transfer PMI airport using scheduled buses with low availability and low accessibility to the visitors, and allow us to excel at what we do becoming a client of us. Our company does not only supply quick Majorca airport transfers, since our company was created customers can request a taxi tour around the city. It is possible to visit the most iconic locations in the metropolis with a fairly cheap fare. Enjoying the urban sights from the comfort of our car seats is one of the best to catch a quick glimpse of the area. This choice is great for planning purposes and for those visitors who have limited time in the city. You can suggest your own route or ask our drivers for a preset taxi tour which will get you to the main points: Palma de Mallorca cathedral, Bellver castle, the coastal walkway, the old town, the Real Palace of Almudena, the old market place of gothic architecture known as Sa Llotja, the town hall, and much more. We are certain that you will enjoy the ride. Please, note that you can call your taxi from your hotel in order to get a transfer PMI airport at the end of your stay in the island. Request an appointment and a car will be waiting for you at the agreed time and date in from of your hotel door in order to pick you up, help with your luggage and drive you to the Palma de Mallorca International Airport departure gate without mishap. For further information on our services and for appointments, please check the contact information we provide.","info@taxitourmallorca.com","8698362","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/28/d5/41/f9/port-blue-2-alcudia.jpg","Spain","false","39.54768",,"es","Taxi Tour Mallorca","Palma de Mallorca, Majorca, Balearic Islands","2.730687","Taxi Tour Mallorca",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1662",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"+34 644 11 35 51","87","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/d5/41/f9/port-blue-2-alcudia.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/5e/2a/03/vehiculos-totalmente.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/12/b6/89/colonia.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/54/ed/eb/cathedral-of-majorca.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/d5/41/f6/port-blue-alcudia.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/3a/00/cd/cap-rocat-2021.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/3a/00/c7/cap-rocat-2021.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/3a/00/c2/amanecer-en-cala-millor.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/3a/00/c1/minivans.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/3a/00/c0/minibuses-con-remolque.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/f7/62/3c/spring-2021-port-de-pollenca.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/f7/62/3b/spring-2021-port-de-pollenca.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/f7/62/3a/spring-2021-port-de-pollenca.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/f7/62/37/spring-2021-port-de-pollenca.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/f7/62/35/spring-2021-port-de-pollenca.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/f7/62/33/spring-2021-port-de-pollenca.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/f7/62/31/spring-2021-port-de-pollenca.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/8b/3d/d5/sillita-grupo-1-2-3.jpg","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/8b/3d/c9/sillita-grupo-2-3.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"95","2","#2 of 95 Transportation in Palma de Mallorca","5","6","4","8","36","1608","4.466860294342041","84","palma airport","141","excellent service","61","return journey","29","always on time","34","on arrival","22","both ways","18","first class service","12","transfer service","11","family holiday","16","highly recommend this company","10","helpful driver","17","meeting point","16","these guys","11","easy booking","8","clean vehicle","9","booster seat","14","flight was delayed","12","driver waiting","8","great company","7","no issues","56","luggage","193","mallorca","94","taxi","45","cars","28","arrivals","25","pickup","11","firm","7","seater","14","villa","12","cases","Transportation",,,,,"Taxis & Shuttles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ATTRACTION","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187463-d8698362-Reviews-Taxi_Tour_Mallorca-Palma_de_Mallorca_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html","http://www.taxitourmallorca.com"

We have been situated in the main shopping center since May 2022 after over 20 years in the little center at the top of the hill. It’s still the same laugh and banter but on a bigger scale. We can show 8 football, rugby, F1, boxing events etc at once on the 60/75 inch TVs. No big match is streamed, all live via legal satellite. Plus all the lower league games. Just give us notice and we will reserve your match. According to our customers we serve the best cocktails around, only using fresh ingredients no premix. DJ Russ is on 6 nights a week with the best comedy dj banter you will ever see and on his night off we have the amazing Drag Comedy Show. Not forgetting. You may even bump into one of our regulars who are sporting greats. Ranging from football, rugby or boxing. Come and join us wherever you are from in Xtreeemz.",,"1193914","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/23/94/2b/25/reopening-night.jpg","Spain","false","27.792784","Av.

Sawadee Krap, Namaste! Welcome to Relax FIRST. How can we help you? First we help our clients to re-experience deep relaxation. It can be dramatically effective in relieving symptoms and health concerns. It can be a lifesaver when dealing with stress and life crises. In this state profound self-healing of body and mind can occur. In the practical work with our clients we feature a feeling, which they describe again and again as a deep, pervasive safety that allows them to give themselves permission to relax, to let go, and to trust our guidance while in this deeply open state. Our studies in the medical and holistic field started in late 70s. Along the way around the world we were certified in all levels of techniques we use for treatments and classes. Thanks to all our teachers, famous and unknown, whose inspirations help us to join with you the state of bliss.

We have a variety of different tours leaving every day with guaranteed departures. All the tours depart right from our main office, where you'll find restrooms and seating while you wait to leave - unlike some operators that meet in the street. All of our tours are in English only, and all of our guides are carefully chosen not just for their knowledge, but also for their charm and compassion. We train all our guides to give a tour as if they were showing their family or friends the places we visit for the very first time. We are passionate about what we do. In fact, we are so determined to deliver the very best, we promise to give you a 100% refund if you´re not happy with our service and we are responsible. Last year over 15,000 customers booked with us. We hope you'll help us beat that this year.","tours@explorecatalunya.com","1602326","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/9d/e9/5a/the-amazing-costa-brava.jpg","Spain","false","41.387432",,"es","Explore

night.","adventurousappetites@yahoo.es","1062558","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/15/8b/ab/adventurous-appetites.jpg","Spain","false","40.416965",,"es","Adventurous Appetites Tapas
